					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;/wen/#comment-134&quot;&gt;Lacey&lt;/a&gt;.

I&#039;ve heard about that line, but I never think to look for it at the beauty supply. Maybe I&#039;ll swing by there today. I do always use color repair, you&#039;re right about that. All those salon brands are usually fine for color though, so I&#039;m going to start branching out. Good comment, Lace!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Oh my goodness where to start!! First so glad to know wen is no miracle I too watched the commercials and thought I need it, but tv stuff hardly ever works so I didn&#039;t do it. However a hairdresser friend of mine who&#039;s worked in all kinds of top salons in LA and San Diego gave me the best bday gift of my life one I never even new was this amazing fabulous brand of hair product!!!! And don&#039;t be fooled that its a buy loreal it&#039;s there high end line K&#039;erastase, I have the green shampoo bottle K&#039;erastase resistance, and the conditioner K&#039;erastase nutritive it&#039;s in an orange container that looks as if its a lotion or something but you leave it in for two minutes or so and rinse and your hair slippery and smooth, the after products you use make a big difference too as far as texture and the ability to work with it my hair can be fine and to soft and weightless so I use not only a root boost but a thickens moose at the roots and this nutrition cream from the same line on the ends then I finish with a shine cream anyhoo after all that my point is you guys may need to find product or shampoos that do different things a lot of time people think oooo color damage repair that&#039;s the one I need when that gives me the worst texture for Aron I&#039;d say try a sleek n shine one and put in an after product that does the same I hope some of this helped its much easier said in person lol sorry for the long post hope it made a little bit of sense oh and on Those K&#039;erastase products a little goes a long way I love that too! Good luck girls, oh and if any blondes read this every other time I shampoo I use a toning shampoo to get my blonde looking like new after all that yellow it begins to get after hair spray and product couldn&#039;t live without it!]]></description>
