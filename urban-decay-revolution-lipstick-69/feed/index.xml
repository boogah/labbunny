Ooh, which shade was it, Shame?  The darkest I&#039;ve gone so far is Jilted.  It&#039;s so pretty, all purple and iridescent.  I don&#039;t know if I&#039;ve got the lady balls to pull off anything darker.  I got a 20% of coupon for Ulta this weekend that was actually valid on UD stuff...so I bought 3 more!  I am now the proud owner of Catfight, Jilted, F-Bomb, and Naked.  No more makeup for me this month though, I&#039;m officially cutting myself off.]]></description>

I want one of the darker ones! I saw a girl wearing one in SF, and I stopped her to be like, &quot;WHAT IS THAT LIPSTICK?!&quot;]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[God, I love these lipsticks.  I finally bought one in Naked, and I have the minis in 69, Catfight, and Anarchy.  They are all fantastic.  The color payoff is insane.  I also love how nicely stained it leaves my lips as it wears off.  Catfight is for sure my next full size purchase.]]></description>
