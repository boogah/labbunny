Lol you learn something new every day! It&#039;s pretty delicious. I was weirded out at first, but once I tried it, I was hooked. Butter is not very different from cream, and the slight saltiness really evens out any bitter coffee taste. It&#039;s very rich and tastes like the best latte you ever had!]]></description>

I looked up the butter coffee, and I am very intrigued! I don&#039;t know if it would be for me all the time, but I can&#039;t really imagine what it tastes like, so I&#039;d be interested in trying it. What a crazy new thing to learn about today! Do you like it? Is it delicious or do you have to get used to it?]]></description>

I eat a ketogenic diet. After years of not being very successful on weight watchers, I made a switch about a year ago and am much happier and skinnier. &quot;Bulletproof&quot; coffee is a staple which has butter and heavy cream in it (and sugar free vanilla syrup). I get to eat lots of bacon and cheese too. It&#039;s freaking amazing.

Anyway, you may be on to something with the over- moisturizing. I&#039;ll have to work on my Chapstick habit :/ I was at target and grabbed the ELF lip exfoliater and primer to try too. Cheapie but I figured they are a good place to start.]]></description>

Coffee butter?! What do you mean?! I need answers! 

I use a lip primer sometimes! That might be a good bet for you. I get a lot of ridges, too. Recently, I stopped over moisturizing, and my lips have evened out. I was a nonstop chapstick applier, but I&#039;ve been using it a lot more sparingly. I don&#039;t know if that&#039;s something you do too, but if it is, it might not be helping. I&#039;ve really tried to cut back to using it just before bed, and maybe once during the day. My lips are doing their thing now, I think. Cell turnover is happening the way it&#039;s supposed to, and not artificially because I&#039;m forcing it. It was weird for the first few days, but my lips are undoubtedly smoother now. I don&#039;t gnaw on them as much, either. I hope all this helps!]]></description>

That is brilliant! I would totally buy/eat it. I get to eat a lot of butter on my diet (even in my coffee) and it makes me way too happy haha!

As for the lipstick, I really don&#039;t know! I do exfoliate my lips and they aren&#039;t chapped. They just seem to have a lot of natural ridges that are exaggerated with lipstick. It just doesn&#039;t look smooth. I do better with a thicker gloss, Sephoras own line is one of my favorites. I have been thinking about trying a lip primer, any thoughts?]]></description>

Haaayyyy Lauren! Do you think we should make a line of lip products that are actually just tinted butter in a tube? I&#039;m into it and I think it&#039;s the best idea I&#039;ve ever had. We would be beautiful and delicious!

I&#039;m glad you stepped out of the lurker shadows and said something. It&#039;s so awesome to hear from you! Also, I bet your lipstick looks great! My ability to wear lipstick is nothing more than confidence and a steady hand. What don&#039;t you like about your lipsticked lips? I&#039;m curious! 

Thanks for reading!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I have been lurking for a while, but I just wanted to say that I am a big fan! We have very similar coloring and I love seeing how the products would look. I&#039;m so envious of your ability to wear lipstick- my lips NEVER look that good!

I also really share your love of butter..]]></description>
