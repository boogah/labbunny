					<description><![CDATA[One weird trick for curling your eyelashes-and it may be bad, but it works for me...  I have tiny eyelashes that are stick straight.  No curve at all to them.  Since I was in my teens, I have been using my hairdryer to &quot;heat&quot; my eyelash curler.  Like a curling iron for your hair.  I make sure that it is not too hot by holding it to my face before it gets anywhere near my eyes.  Seems to help hold the &quot;curl.&quot;  If not, by the end of the day, they are once again stick straight.  Just a tip for ya...]]></description>
