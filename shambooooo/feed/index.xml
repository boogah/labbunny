&lt;a href=&quot;http://dormroomcurly.blogspot.com/2008/12/style-definitions-table.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Read this&lt;/a&gt;, Tisha. It&#039;s a blog for curly haired girls, but it explains the system pretty thoroughly. I think silicone based products will build up, so you have to try to use products that don&#039;t have that, and if you do, maybe use a clarifying shampoo that fits the criteria once a week.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I did it with actual no poo--I&#039;d steep lemon verbena or lavender and mix that with the apple cider vinegar; I made a baking soda concoction to wash my scalp with. While it worked, and made my hair feel strong, it also kinda felt like straw. And it stripped my red hair dye pretty badly. it takes about 3 weeks to stop having gross over oil production and brushing your hair a ton with a boar bristle brush will help a lot.

Eventually I switched to basically co-washing--with Wen--and an occasional sulfate free shampoo with purology when it was extra dirty, maybe once a week or every other week. It&#039;s important even if you&#039;re co-washing to only do it every 3-5 days---the other days just rinse with hot water and scrub your scalp with your hands. If your ends are dry, add coconut oil to them, or some other type of natural hair oil like argan, etc--just not a product with silicon.

GL and can&#039;t wait to hear how it ends up for you.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I might be willing to take a shot at this with you...  For science.  My only issue is what if I use products in my hair like, hairspray, etc.?  Will the co-washing (I like no-poo better) get it clean and get the products out?  I may have a hard time sticking to it if I can&#039;t get the products out.]]></description>
