					<description><![CDATA[I love the basic Cover Girl mascara in the pink tube.   Actually, my fav mascara of all time was the $2 a tube Wet n Wild, but nobody carries it anymore?!  I&#039;ve tried various expensive mascaras over the years and they always seen to flake off easily and get in my eyes?  Maybe I should give this one a shot.  As I get older, my eyelashes are getting shorter  :-(]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;/benefit-theyre-real-mascara/#comment-193&quot;&gt;Liz&lt;/a&gt;.

I haven&#039;t noticed that at all! To me, it doesn&#039;t seem any more difficult to remove than any really effective mascara. That isn&#039;t the kind of thing that bothers me anyways. You know?]]></description>
