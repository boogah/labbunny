					<description><![CDATA[I seriously can&#039;t believe they&#039;re still sending out that polish...I got a bottle months ago when I was still signed up for Birchbox.  And it&#039;s still sitting unopened.  Way too &quot;shrinking violet&quot; for my fabulous talons.

I like the way you think though...a Birchbox/Burn Notice team-up would definitely get me to resubscribe!  I&#039;d want Fiona to do the picking though, girl&#039;s got style.  Maybe some Hawaiian print hair ties in honor of Sam?  Perfume that&#039;s really knockout gas?  C&#039;mon Birchbox, give the people what they want! ;)]]></description>
