Okay, here&#039;s where I get all my Naked 3 rumor mongering from: http://www.reddit.com/r/MakeupAddiction/comments/1n1u1y/just_got_word_sephora_is_expecting_the_naked_3/

It&#039;s Reddit, so I try to take it with a grain of salt...but I&#039;m so excited at the prospect.  I&#039;ll probably wait on getting another until after 12/22 just to be safe. :)

I absolutely agree with you on the old UD lipstick packaging.  I love a good goth vibe as much as the next gal, but they took it a bit too far.  The new packaging is sexy as hell!  I actually wrote UD a letter begging them for a sampler, so we&#039;ll see in a few months if they listen to me.   :)]]></description>

Oooooohhh!! GET IT GURL!! 

I love all of my Naked palettes, and if they do make a third one, I&#039;ll probably buy that one too! I use all of them together nearly every time I do my makeup, even if I&#039;m doing color. I skipped Vice because I have a ton of those Book of Shadows palettes, and after so many cycles, they start to become redundant. You know? Your comment is actually the first I&#039;ve heard of the possibility of a third Naked palette. The internet doesn&#039;t seem to know much either, so I&#039;m verrrrry intrigued!

I only have one of the new UD lipsticks, and I really want to replace the old ones with the new ones. The packaging on their old lipsticks is super annoying, and they used to have this &quot;creme brÃ»lÃ©e&quot; scent that was off putting to a lot of people. I didn&#039;t love it, but whatever. The new lipsticks are so much better. I&#039;d buy minis of the entire collection too. I tried to win the full set of their new lipsticks all over the internet when they first came out, but, no luck! I should just suck it up and replace them. Especially the really old ones. I think I&#039;ve had one of those lipsticks for like, 5 years. I think that&#039;s wrong. Hahahaha]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Okay, so I&#039;m guessing the fact that all three Naked palettes get to live in this bag mean you don&#039;t regret buying them!  I have the original Naked, and I&#039;ve been debating getting the Naked 2 or Naked Basics, but I&#039;m wondering how useful it&#039;ll be to have all three.  Thoughts?  Plus, I keep hearing rumors that the Naked 3 is going to be released right before Christmas...supposedly Sephora employees are confirming this, so that throws off my planning even more!  And I just picked up the Vice 2, so I&#039;m really trying to behave myself now.

Also, I&#039;m a jealous girl right now over those UD Lipsticks!  I managed to snag 69, Catfight, and Anarchy minis, but I want them all.  Especially Naked.  I would pay crazy money if UD released minis of the entire collection.  There is actually a new Ulta opening in my town this weekend, and the first 100 people there each day get a gift card for up to $100...I&#039;m gonna hit it up tomorrow and try to bribe the girl handing them out to hook me up with a good one.]]></description>
