*FURIOUSLY GOOGLES EXERCISE TAPE THAT I DID NOT KNOW EXISTED*

I know what you mean about falling in love! She gets such a bad rap, but she seems like she could be really fun to hang out with!]]></description>

Yes, the shoes were horrible. Not because there was anything wrong or unnatural or whatever, about having swollen feet during pregnancy... but just.. OUCH. How about some nice flats? Or wedges? Or less strappy? 

But I can&#039;t imagine living with the pressure she does to look glam 24/7 so who knows if I would be cramming my feet into something like that too.

THANK YOU! Daily glamour! My biggest issue with her wardrobe during her pregnancy was the shoes! I&#039;d see her poor swollen feet, and be like, &quot;Gurl. Give yourself a break! Ain&#039;t no shame in flats!&quot; Oh. That couch dress wasn&#039;t great either. But, I think that was mostly the gloves. I would have liked it more without them.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Another KK lover here :) Although she did make some questionable fashion choices during her pregnancy, I never understood why people attacked her body instead of saying the clothes she wore were unflattering... 
She makes being glam on a daily basis into something we all strive for.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Sold! No, seriously, how can anyone look at the first pic, the contouring pic, and the Mother Goddess pic without falling in love?

I&#039;ve never been a &lt;i&gt;fan&lt;/i&gt;, per se, but one time, at random, I did one of her exercise tapes and she completely charmed me. I think it was the combination of her self-confidence and her willingness to laugh at herself.]]></description>

I love her so much!! Hahaha! I like that you said Sophia Loren, because I was going to say she was a new kind of beauty, but I remembered Sophia. Fabulous!]]></description>
