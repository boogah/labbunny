					<description><![CDATA[Transitioning to New Face Moisterizer - How?
So, a couple weeks ago, I ran out of my OHA face moisturizer, which I&#039;ve been using for a couple of years.  I wasn&#039;t going to order anymore because I was going to transition to Origins Anti-aging Face Cream (which is really a moisturizer, but they just call it a cream).  Anyway, I keep stalling on ordering my new moisturizer, so while at Target, I picked up some cetaphil (on your suggestion).  I love the texture of it and that it has an SPF in it.  However, since I&#039;ve been using it, my face has been more oily than usual (before Cetaphil, I was using a 60 SPF Vanicream under my OHA moisturizer (Vanicream was recommended by my dermatologist).  ANYWAY...is there a particular transition strategy that I should use when moving away from the old and towards the new (like you use when changing dog food)?  Or do I just dive in?  And is my sking just going through an adjustment period with the Cetaphil?  I just don&#039;t know. I&#039;m worried that when I finally get my new Origins moisturizer ordered, my skin will really freak out.  Thanks!]]></description>
