Thanks, Darci! It&#039;s Rebel by MAC with a mattifying powder over the top. I really had to wrack my brain to remember what it was! It came to me just as I was starting to go crazy. Whew!]]></description>

Supposedly the henna won&#039;t fade out...we&#039;ll see.  I am the opposite of no-poo, I gotta scrub my hair once a day or I feel grungy, so my red always fades out to basically my natural color.]]></description>

Good luck! I had bright red hair for a minute a few years ago, and I never would have kept it as long as I did if I hadn&#039;t worked at a salon back then.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m to that point even just trying to keep my hair red...I can&#039;t imagine the upkeep with blue!  You&#039;re a stronger woman than I am, although, as stated above that blue looked amazing on you.  This weekend I&#039;m giving henna a shot for the first time to get a red that won&#039;t immediately fade out.  I did a test run on some hair from my brush last week and it seemed to go okay, so I guess we&#039;ll see.  If it ends badly, I&#039;m joining you on TEAM WIG!]]></description>
