Ummm. Wow. I just watched this, and I&#039;m impressed! I saw what she was going to to do to lay that first line down, and I said out loud, &quot;Ahhhhhhhh. Clever.&quot; I&#039;m really glad you found something that works for you. Just keep practicing, and soon, you won&#039;t even need to line it up, your eye and hand will just know where to stop. Well, most of the time anyways. Like, 95% of the time.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Okay, so I withheld allowing myself to comment on this one until I could finally give myself an acceptable cat eye.  I&#039;m so jealous of your skills.  About a billion Youtube tutorials later, I finally got it!  This is the one that finally worked for me: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DLLNohnjRJU

It&#039;s like magic.  And they match each other!  As a reward, I&#039;m letting myself get this Stila liner.]]></description>
