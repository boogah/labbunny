					<description><![CDATA[They all look seriously great on you!  I&#039;m consistently amazed by how good most of these shades can look on different skin tones.  I&#039;m as pale as a ghost, but Jilted, Catfight, F Bomb, and Naked are all really flattering.  I&#039;m guessing Native and Protest might not work as well.  Or at least that&#039;s what I&#039;ll keep telling myself so I&#039;m not bummed over missing this deal!]]></description>
