					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;/coconut-oil-hair-mask-results-show/#comment-1070&quot;&gt;Lisa&lt;/a&gt;.

Almost exactly a year ago, I tried the coconut oil hair treatment (see above). It didn&#039;t destroy my hair, but it made it worse for the wear, more frizzy than it normally is. I have since switched to an aloe-containing hair products and my hair has never been better! Use more conditioner, my fellow 2A wavy haired friends! You hair NEEDS the moisture! Don&#039;t weigh it down with oils.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Oh my! Hmm, here&#039;s my experience with coconut oil for my hair...

I bleached my hair a few years ago and used to use coconut oil on my hair.

I would wash my hair as normal in the shower, then towel dry my hair after, then rub a tiny amount of coconut oil into my hands then rub it down my hair. When it dried, it was shiny and nice. I would also, only rub it on the ends of my hair not any where near my scalp, to smooth out my dry ends. 

I have since grown out the blonde and am back to my natural dark brown. I tried to do this method recently but it just left my ends looking greasy. I think it worked on my bleached hair because it was SO DAMN dry! 

Also, when I say I used a tiny amount, I mean miniscule! I would get the bottle, place my palm over the top to seal it, tip it upside down to get the oil onto my hand, tip it back up and wipe the excess oil off. Rub my hands together then rub it down my hair on both sides and maybe do that twice for each side if my hair was really frizzy and dry.

I found leaving olive oil in my hair has worked nicely in the past as a mask. I&#039;ve also seen some &quot;hair masks&quot; you can make using coconut oil, maybe try those instead of straight oil. 

Have Fun!
