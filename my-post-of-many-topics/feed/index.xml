					<description><![CDATA[I tried red lipstick this week, but I never made it out of the house with it on.  Matt thinks it&#039;s old-lady-ish. I know!  What does he know, right?  Also, I&#039;ve been applying for a job closer to my home since November 2011, which is like six months before we even MOVED to the house we live in now.  Seriously?!  That&#039;s coming on TWO years. *Depressed* #suckmydickeconomy So, that&#039;s what&#039;s going on with me.  Can&#039;t wait to see what J brought you from Austin because you KNOW he bought you something!  Hugs!]]></description>
