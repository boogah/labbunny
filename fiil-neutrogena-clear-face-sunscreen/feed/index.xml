					<description><![CDATA[IF YOU ARE GOING TO USE A BAND&#039;S SONG TITLE &#038; PICTURE AS A PART OF YOUR POST, AT LEAST USE A PICTURE OF THE REAL LEAD SINGER. IF YOU HAVE ANY KNOWLEDGE OF THE LEAD SINGER YOU IMMEDIATELY KNOW THIS IS NOT HIM, NO MATTER IF YOU CAN SEE HIS CAN SEE HIS WHOLE FACE OR NOT. 

This is a picture of an actor of a film that was **not** modeled after the lead singer of this song, only the makeup &#038; clothes the lead singer wears. 

Truly a disgrace to see this, as this is an influential band for many people all over the world. The Cure&#039;s music spans close to forty years. 

I have followed you for a while now, as I enjoy your humorous and fun vibe. I also get the vibe that you&#039;ve got strong personality, which I admire. Opinions are like a-holes, we all have one. You may not like my a-hole &#038; probably think I am one for writing this comment. 

It will be interesting to see if you are a blogger who can handle the criticism and allow my comment to be posted or those who delete it.]]></description>
