Your skin looks great, so you&#039;re doing something right. I want to look into that Retin-A thing!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I&#039;ve had the skin tags removed off my skin twice.  Wait until you get pregnant (someday).  They only get worse.  My dermatologist has told me not to wear necklaces or anything that rubs on my skin.  I guess friction causes them?  Also, I&#039;m not sure how to keep from getting them, but getting them lasered off is no big deal.  I would love to try that no-tag stuff that apparently removes them naturally.  Regarding anti-aging stuff, I feel like I&#039;ve been using anti-aging cream forever.  I remember that you were the one to tell me that anti-aging cream and lotion are NOT the same thing (was that like 10 years ago?).  Duh.  Anyway, as I&#039;ve gotten older, I invest a lot more money in quality anti-aging creams, lotions, soaps, etc.  I am using Origins now.  And I guess it&#039;s okay?  I don&#039;t know.  I can&#039;t tell a difference, which is maybe a good thing.  Nothing is getting worse (knock on wood!!!).  My mom uses Obagi and she has amazing skin.  Also, she buys Retin-A (online from Mexico, so you know its the good shit) and uses that about once a week on her face and neck.  Also, everyone, don&#039;t forget about your neck and chest area.  AND your hands.  Those two areas, women forget about, but they are the biggest indicators of age.  Just look at the Real Housewives.  Anyway, that&#039;s that.  I used a lot of &quot;also&quot;s in this reply.  Whatev.]]></description>
