					<description><![CDATA[We have a rule in our house that if you love something from Trader Joe&#039;s you have to loudly announce just the opposite. &quot;Boy, I HATE this! I hope Trader Joe&#039;s stops making it FOREVER! It&#039;s horrible!&quot; I am still not over the loss of my spicy biryani in a microwaveable pouch.

That said, I&#039;m going to jinx myself and admit I love TJ&#039;s body butter, too. Especially the pumpkin one.

Thanks for such a great blog!]]></description>
