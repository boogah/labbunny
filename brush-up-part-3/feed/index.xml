I am the worst about keeping makeup past when you should. I&#039;m a greedy hoarder! I try to go through my stuff a couple times a year and get rid of the things I&#039;m not using. If products smell funny, or the consistency has changed, they should be tossed. Since it&#039;s very easy to get eye infections, mascaras should probably be replaced most frequently. 
Brushes should be washed about once a week.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[How often do you wash your brushes?  Also, how long can makeup stay in your rotation.  On the Today show they were saying that you should get rid of lipstick after 3-6 months because of bacteria buildup?!  If that&#039;s the case, then my favorite lipstick that is 6-7 years old should have killed me by now!]]></description>
