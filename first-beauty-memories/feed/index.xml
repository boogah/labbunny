					<description><![CDATA[Speaking of gold glitter I have a memory I was just talking to my sister about, in 6th grade I used to wear body glitter like it was my skin couldn&#039;t live without it and one Christmas Eve night we were all dressed up ready for church I just had to add my finishing touch (the roll on glitter) and sure as shit I was out! Ahh so in a hurry and a panic I grabbed my wet n wild glitter nail polish and painted my eyelids! Lol big mistake it dropped into my eyes burned like hell just a big mess I don&#039;t recommend that to anyone :)]]></description>
