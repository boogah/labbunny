					<description><![CDATA[Okay, so this is a reply almost 2 yrs after you wrote this post.  But something I loooove doing (guilty pleasure) when I fall in love with a scent is to google random reviews about it to get a feel for how others love (or hate) it.  Lust is such an in-your-face scent that I&#039;ve been a tad apprehensive about wearing it to events where people may be offended by its potency.  It&#039;s defintely not a subtle or common fragrance that you catch a whiff of time to time.  So heady and loud.  I went directly to Lush with my two toddlers (a brave adventure) after reading such intriguing reviews about &quot;Lust&quot; and just HAD to smell.   It&#039;s nothing like I had imagined and honestly made me almost gag as I excitedly held my hand up to my nose after a quick spritz.  It just wasn&#039;t what I had expected and so we left the store and walked around the mall for a bit.  But then... I COULD NOT STOP SMELLING MY HAND.  It&#039;s like trying to look away from something horrifying, but you can&#039;t stop.  I got home that night and must have randomly lifted my hand to my nose over 50 times throughout the evening.  I went back two days later and bought it.  It&#039;s so strange to me how many people had the exact same reaction in reviews.  Being completely knocked in the face by it and then can&#039;t get enough.  I enjoyed your entire post, even the backstory leading into the review.  Nothing can quite prepare you for this scent.  But then it&#039;s an obsession..   I will try it as my signature scent for the next few weeks/months and see how it goes. Some say they get constant compliments and inquiries when wearing it, and others say it makes everyone around them instantly disgusted, hahah.   I guess it&#039;s a love/hate fragrance.  There&#039;s really no on-the-fence with this one..]]></description>

It was a few years ago, so they might have discontinued it again. I found some on Amazon just now, so check there! It&#039;s more expensive, but it&#039;s an option. Sorry I couldn&#039;t be more help! XO]]></description>

YES! A social superpower! I like to pretend I just naturally smell like that. &quot;Oh, that? It&#039;s just my essence. No big deal.&quot; Have you smelled their other jasmine scent, Sikkim Girls? It&#039;s great too!]]></description>
