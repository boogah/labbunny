Almost exactly a year ago, I tried the coconut oil hair treatment (see above). It didn&#039;t destroy my hair, but it made it worse for the wear, more frizzy than it normally is. I have since switched to an aloe-containing hair products and my hair has never been better! Use more conditioner, my fellow 2A wavy haired friends! You hair NEEDS the moisture! Don&#039;t weigh it down with oils.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Oh my! Hmm, here&#039;s my experience with coconut oil for my hair...

I bleached my hair a few years ago and used to use coconut oil on my hair.

I would wash my hair as normal in the shower, then towel dry my hair after, then rub a tiny amount of coconut oil into my hands then rub it down my hair. When it dried, it was shiny and nice. I would also, only rub it on the ends of my hair not any where near my scalp, to smooth out my dry ends. 

I have since grown out the blonde and am back to my natural dark brown. I tried to do this method recently but it just left my ends looking greasy. I think it worked on my bleached hair because it was SO DAMN dry! 

Also, when I say I used a tiny amount, I mean miniscule! I would get the bottle, place my palm over the top to seal it, tip it upside down to get the oil onto my hand, tip it back up and wipe the excess oil off. Rub my hands together then rub it down my hair on both sides and maybe do that twice for each side if my hair was really frizzy and dry.

I found leaving olive oil in my hair has worked nicely in the past as a mask. I&#039;ve also seen some &quot;hair masks&quot; you can make using coconut oil, maybe try those instead of straight oil. 

Have Fun!

					<description><![CDATA[I don&#039;t know why I only just decided to look this up right now with the oil already in my hair. I used 1/4 cup as well, avoided the scalp, and put it all over my frizzy, ultra thin hair. Leaving it in for 30 minutes, then rising like Kali warned to do. Let&#039;s hope it doesn&#039;t turn out too bad!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Probably a little late, but here&#039;s how I do it. Start with extra virgin or virgin, unrefined coconut oil, NOT refined. I have pretty thick hair that goes down to my lower back, and I only us maybe one and a half to two tablespoons MAX. A fourth cup is too much. After you put it in your hair, wrap it up and let it sit overnight. In the morning hop in the shower and rinse with very warm water for at least a minute while running your fingers from root to tip to get excess oil out. Next shampoo your hair and roots, still running your fingers from root to tip to prevent tangling. Rinse and do a second shampoo. Then condition with your normal conditioner.

I realize that sounds complicated, but it isn&#039;t, so I will list it out shorter

1.Coat hair with 1.5 tablespoons of coconut oil.

2. Wrap and let sit overnight.

3. Rinse hair for a whole minute.

4. Shampoo and rinse twice.

5. Condition your hair and rinse.]]></description>

Awwww, Jenny! I feel like we had the same sucky results. I totally know how you feel, and it&#039;s such a bummer! One thing I&#039;ve REALLY learned doing this site is that sometimes, things just don&#039;t work for me. I think that the voices that have positive results are SO POSITIVE, that they&#039;re really the only results we hear about. That&#039;s kind of why I wrote about how bad it came out for me. Don&#039;t get discouraged, it&#039;s not just you! There&#039;s something out there that will work for you, and you&#039;ll love it, and coconut oil as a hair treatment can get effed!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I tried the overnight coconut oil cap for the first time last night and I loved it! My hair is pretty thick and damaged but I&#039;m trying to grow it out long and don&#039;t want to keep cutting it. It was getting to the point where it was hard to straighten so I thought I&#039;d give the overnight coconut oil treatment a try. Last night before bed I scooped out some of the solid coconut oil and warmed it with my hands to mostly liquid state. Then I put it all over my dry hair. I put my hair in a ponytail, covered it with the cap, and went to bed. When I woke up this morning I shampooed and conditioned as I normally would. I also used a leave in protector spray when I brushed my hair while blow drying and straightening. My hair hasnt been as soft and easy to style as it was today in a long time. I am so glad it worked because I was starting to feel hopeless about my hair. I&#039;m doing it again tonight!]]></description>
