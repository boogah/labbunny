Sure!! Haha! I think I felt like I had more hair options without my bangs, and I am NOT using them to their maximum potential right now. They aren&#039;t covering my hairy eyebrows at all.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m in that will I or won&#039;t I stage with my bangs right now...they&#039;re getting so long, and I&#039;ve been thinking about just letting them grow.  But, I love how put together they make me look, with minimal effort.  Plus, not having to put foundation on my forehead has got to be saving me some money, right?]]></description>

Erin. You have to learn there ain&#039;t no shame in yo game! Your short hair looks boss on you. The way to look your fucking best is to work with what you have in the way it wants to be worked. Your hair is never going to be straight without soooo much time, effort and product. So, FUCK IT! It doesn&#039;t love you! Let it go....give it to God. You look cool as HELL.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[My bangs are practically grown out and I miss them! They are a lazy girls dream because even when you don&#039;t want to do your hair, if you can manage to do your bangs, you look somewhat put together. You look smokin hot!]]></description>
