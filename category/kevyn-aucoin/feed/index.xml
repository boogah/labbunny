										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Along with Fall (my birthday, Halloween, no more bathing suits), Christmas is one of my favorite times of the year. Christmas the day is whatever to me; I love giving and getting presents, but all that cooking and cleaning can get out of here. The month leading up to Christmas is awesome though! People are nicer to each other, there are lights, and songs, and ornaments, and hot cocoa, and cookies! CHRISTMAS MOVIES! I&#8217;ve already watched &#8220;Christmas Vacation,&#8221; and &#8220;Love Actually.&#8221; I&#8217;ll hit &#8220;Scrooged&#8221; and &#8220;White Christmas&#8221; sometime soon. I&#8217;m emotionally gearing up for &#8220;Miracle on 34th Street,&#8221; and I&#8217;m saving &#8220;It&#8217;s a Wonderful Life&#8221; to watch with my mom. We like to cry together over that one. Stupid George Bailey gets me every time.</p>
<p>So, looking forward to Christmas, and inspired by a conversation I had with a friend, I&#8217;d like to help out with your shopping. Is my gift guide late to the party? Of course it is! Late to the party is my middle name. I actually like to BE late to parties. I wait just long enough for people to start wondering if I&#8217;m coming, and then BOOM there I am, drink in hand, making all your dreams come true.</p>
<p>This guide is for the budding makeup artist in your life, or for anyone who wants to improve their skills and get a little education.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>&#8220;Making Faces&#8221; by Kevyn Aucoin</strong></span></p>

<p style="text-align: left;"><a title="Making Faces by Kevyn Aucoin" href="/making-faces-by-kevyn-aucoin/">I wrote about my adoration for this book a couple months ago.</a> I&#8217;ve had my copy for nearly 15 years, and I still break it out all the time. I learned a lot about makeup application from my mom, but where her knowledge ended, this book picked it up. It&#8217;s extremely comprehensive and easy to understand, with clear instructions and pictures. Kevyn doesn&#8217;t just show you how to do eyeshadow, he shows you how to build your entire face from your bone structure up. His two makeup books are the only two I own. Nothing else comes close. &#8220;Making Faces&#8221; is an excellent guide for anyone, beginner or more experienced.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><a href="&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0316286850/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=0316286850&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=thlabu-20&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://ir-na.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?t=thlabu-20&amp;l=as2&amp;o=1&amp;a=0316286850&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; style=&quot;border:none !important; margin:0px !important;&quot; /&gt;">Buy &#8220;Making Faces&#8221; <strong>HERE</strong>.</a></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Sonia Kashuk Limited Edition Lavish Luxe 10 piece Brush Set</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-833" alt="Brush set" src="/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/Brush-set.png" width="594" height="480" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/Brush-set.png 594w, /wp-content/uploads/2013/12/Brush-set-300x242.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 594px) 100vw, 594px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://www.target.com/p/sonia-kashuk-limited-edition-lavish-luxe-10-pc-brush-set/-/A-14637465#prodSlot=medium_1_16"><em>Target, $29.99</em></a></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">If you&#8217;re buying for a beginner, you probably want to get them brushes that are nice, but not too expensive. This Sonia Kashuk set fits the bill perfectly. Are they the most high quality, makeup artist level brushes in the world? No. But, they&#8217;re pretty nice. Every Sonia Kashuk brush I have has stood up to frequent use and cleanings without any problems. This set is a good place to start building a brush collection. It has everything a beginner should need, and some stuff they&#8217;ll probably have to figure out. That&#8217;s fun though! That&#8217;s learning! I bought a set of brushes in beauty school almost 10 years ago that had a weird shaped brush in it. I never could figure it out until just this year! Mystery solved! The new artist in your life will get a lot of use out of these brushes, and they&#8217;ll be glad to not have to use those weird sponge foam tipped applicator things. Do they even put those in makeup anymore? Am I showing my age? Wait. Does pantyhose still come in eggs? Does anybody wear pantyhose anymore?! The internet sure has changed everything!</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">It doesn&#8217;t look like this brush set is available online, but they have it in store. At Target&#8217;s site, you can search the stores close to you for specific products, so that makes things easy.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://www.ulta.com/ulta/browse/productDetail.jsp?productId=xlsImpprod5960730"><em>Ulta exclusive, $39.00</em></a></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><a title="Smashbox Wonder Vision Mega Palette" href="/smashbox-wonder-vision-mega-palette/">I JUST reviewed this palette last week</a>, and it&#8217;s on sale now! How fortuitous! Last week, I talked about how I thought this palette would be fantastic for beginners, anyone who wants to expand their options without spending a lot of money, and anyone who struggles with palettes in general. I stand by all of that! With 30 shadows, 3 blushes and 1 bronzer, it&#8217;s got almost everything you&#8217;d need to start learning. The colors are wide ranging and beautifully coordinated with different finishes and consistencies. The palette even comes with clear, plastic instructional cards you place over the shadows to learn how to apply different eyeshadow looks. It was a great deal at $49, it&#8217;s a KILLER deal at $39. Plus, right now, with any $30 Smashbox purchase at Ulta, you get deluxe sample sizes of their fab Classic Primer and Photo Op Eye Brightening Mascara. Even better!</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><a href="http://www.ulta.com/ulta/browse/productDetail.jsp?productId=xlsImpprod5960730">Buy the Smashbox Wondervision Mega Palette exclusively at Ulta <strong>HERE</strong>.</a></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Throw in a couple of lipsticks or lip glosses. NYX and E.L.F. both have cheap, but good lip products. And right now there are tonnnnns of lipstick and gloss sets that are crazy cheap. Add in some brush cleanser because it&#8217;s never too early to learn to keep your tools clean and well maintained! You can get everything I&#8217;ve shown here for $85. So you can get a couple lippies and a cleanser and still keep it under $100. This will all make for a good start, and a happy makeup lover!</p>

<p>I had no idea what I was going to run for today&#8217;s Friday I&#8217;m in Love. I have something for next week, but that would call for a photo, and my hair is in no condition to be captured online for all eternity.</p>
<p>Have you guys noticed that my hair is always a mess? I feel like I talk about it nonstop. Seriously, if I didn&#8217;t think I would look exactly like my dad, I&#8217;d shave it off. Girls that can pull off shaved heads are dead sexy to me. Doesn&#8217;t it sound so freeing? My friend that does my hair would probably stab me to death with her scissors if I asked her to just shave it off. I like to make her do things to my hair she doesn&#8217;t want to do, but that would probably be too far. She&#8217;d snap!</p>
<p>Lucky for me, during a conversation with a friend last night, I mentioned this book, and my brain hamster started running on her wheel.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-522" alt="making faces" src="/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/making-faces-809x1024.jpg" width="696" height="880" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/making-faces-809x1024.jpg 809w, /wp-content/uploads/2013/08/making-faces-237x300.jpg 237w, /wp-content/uploads/2013/08/making-faces-1272x1608.jpg 1272w, /wp-content/uploads/2013/08/making-faces.jpg 1619w" sizes="(max-width: 696px) 100vw, 696px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Making-Faces-Kevyn-Aucoin/dp/0316286850/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1375457882&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=making+faces"><em><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Making Faces</span> by Kevyn Aucoin, $16.01</em></a></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">You&#8217;re looking at my own well loved, bruised and battered (mmm&#8230;.battered) copy here. I&#8217;ve hauled this book around with me from house to apartment to pool house to house to apartment to house to apartment to house since 1999. You can&#8217;t tell from this picture, but the pages are coming loose and it&#8217;s full of random bookmarks. I love this book. I&#8217;m not exaggerating. I have actual love in my heart for this book. If they ever stopped printing it, I&#8217;d put my copy under lock and key, in an underground bunker, behind some of those lasers you can only get past if you do sexy butt wiggles all around them.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">It&#8217;s like this: if George Michael&#8217;s video for &#8220;Too Funky&#8221; is my origin story, then <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Making Faces</span> is my time spent on a Chinese mountain with Pai Mei, learning the Five Point Palm Exploding Heart Technique.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Kevyn Aucoin was an extremely gifted and talented artist. His techniques and advice still hold up, and even at nearly 15 years later, his looks aren&#8217;t dated. This book covers nearly everything you&#8217;d need to know about starting out in makeup, and taking your makeup to the next level. It has segments on skincare and prep, facial structure, shading and highlighting, brows, foundation, concealer, liner, lashes, lips and cheeks. It even has a little bit on cosmetic surgery. He doesn&#8217;t just tell you about eyeliner and lipsticks, he talks about different eye and lip shapes. He doesn&#8217;t just tell you about contouring, he shows you in an exaggerated, easy to follow way, where everything is supposed to go. He&#8217;ll teach you how to build a face that will highlight your best features, or, he&#8217;ll teach you how to completely cover your eyebrows so you can draw on new ones. This book is brilliant. Completely.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">After he teaches you the basics of makeup, he shows you wearable looks for many, many, many different faces and occasions, following that with more in depth costume and heavy transformation looks. The step by step instructions are easy to follow and well illustrated, and the photos are totally stunning.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-523" alt="making faces courtney love" src="/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/making-faces-courtney-love-1024x768.jpg" width="696" height="522" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/making-faces-courtney-love-1024x768.jpg 1024w, /wp-content/uploads/2013/08/making-faces-courtney-love-300x225.jpg 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2013/08/making-faces-courtney-love-1272x954.jpg 1272w" sizes="(max-width: 696px) 100vw, 696px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>This is so beautiful, it hurts my heart.</em></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">I mean, look at freaking Courtney Love up there!! I&#8217;ll admit to having a soft spot for her looks through the years, disheveled and otherwise, but come on. This look, this photo, it&#8217;s really something ethereal.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>SIDE NOTE:</strong> When I was, like, 13, I told my mom I wished I looked like Courtney Love and she was all, &#8220;LIKE A <em>HEROIN ADDICT</em>?!?!&#8221; And I was like, whoooah, yeesh, calm down. I just wanted to have real big boobs and be able to wear one of those clingy satiny dresses without rolls showing. Hey, one out of two ain&#8217;t bad.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">All the years I&#8217;ve had this book, I still break it out to check myself. I feel like I can still learn from it, even though, not s my own d, my own makeup skills are above average.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Please, please buy this book for yourself. I promise you will be completely enthralled, entertained and educated.</p>
