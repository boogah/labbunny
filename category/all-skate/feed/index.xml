										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I don&#8217;t have much today. It&#8217;s been kind of a slow week around here, actually.</p>
<p>Jason has been in Austin since Monday, and I thought that would mean I&#8217;d get so much work done, but it really means I just wander around bored and watch &#8220;Mermaids.&#8221; I <strong>have</strong> been dealing with trying to figure out which smoke detector is chirping since Sunday night, so that&#8217;s been keeping me pretty busy. It&#8217;s never the first one you rip off the wall&#8230;..</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve started to revert to my feral single life again! I keep eating Cheerios for meals that aren&#8217;t breakfast, I&#8217;m talking to myself and the dog like we&#8217;re 3 different people, I have a burglar beater next to the bed, and I&#8217;m scared of slipping in the shower. Plus, my husband has become really funny and charming again, so you know I&#8217;ve been without DAT D for a while now.</p>
<p>YEEZUS FUCK WHICH ONE OF THESE THINGS IS CHIRPING?!?!</p>
<p>Serenity now. Jason will be home later today to reach all of them, and I can move on with my life.</p>
<p>I wanted to do a Friday I&#8217;m in Love today, but my photo backdrop keeps falling off the wall, so I said, &#8220;FUCK THIS,&#8221; and just left it down. On top of that hazardous condition, I&#8217;m trying to get myself on a new eyebrow threading schedule, so I&#8217;m a mess. I kept going to get my brow and lip threading done when I was on my period, and that&#8217;s, like, the WORST time to do that kind of thing. It hurts way more. So, for the sake of my face, I sacrificed my face. I&#8217;m really pretty brave, if Â you think about it.</p>
<p>Since I don&#8217;t have anything of substance today, can I just show you a bunch of random semi-beauty related stuff? Yes? Good!</p>
<p><img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-560" alt="babewolf" src="/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/babewolf-768x1024.jpg" width="696" height="928" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/babewolf-768x1024.jpg 768w, /wp-content/uploads/2013/08/babewolf-225x300.jpg 225w, /wp-content/uploads/2013/08/babewolf-1272x1696.jpg 1272w" sizes="(max-width: 696px) 100vw, 696px" /></p>
<p>I bought this rad <a href="http://www.etsy.com/listing/121781082/babewolf-sticker?ref=shop_home_active">&#8220;Babewolf&#8221; sticker</a> for myself from <a href="http://saramlyons.tumblr.com/">Sara M. Lyons</a>, and slapped it on my laptop. I fucking love this sticker. Her armpits really <a title="Hair Apparent" href="/hair-apparent/">speak to me</a>. I need her to make some kind of bunny girl to balance out the other side!</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">I just found <a href="http://saramlyons.tumblr.com/post/29136201971/in-lux-we-trust-an-oldie-but-goodie">this art</a> she did too, and I feel dizzy, like if I don&#8217;t own something, ANYTHING with this on it, my life will always be a little worse.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://saramlyons.tumblr.com/post/29136201971/in-lux-we-trust-an-oldie-but-goodie"><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-561" alt="in lux we trust" src="/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/in-lux-we-trust.jpg" width="500" height="567" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/in-lux-we-trust.jpg 500w, /wp-content/uploads/2013/08/in-lux-we-trust-264x300.jpg 264w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>MY GUY</em></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">I&#8217;ll name a baby Lux. I swear I&#8217;ll do it.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://www.xovain.com/how-to/make-lipstick-out-of-crayons"><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-562" alt="crayon lipstick" src="/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/crayon-lipstick.jpg" width="630" height="421" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/crayon-lipstick.jpg 630w, /wp-content/uploads/2013/08/crayon-lipstick-300x200.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 630px) 100vw, 630px" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Here&#8217;s <a href="http://www.xovain.com/how-to/make-lipstick-out-of-crayons">THIS weird and cool looking tutorial</a> on xovain about making your own lipstick out of crayons. I&#8217;ve never even considered that before, but it&#8217;s interesting. I&#8217;d like one of you craftier readers to do this, and tell me how it goes. I don&#8217;t want to do it, I&#8217;m not that ambitious, and I only have one stainless steel bowl.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">What else we got?</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Oh. My oldest niece is suddenly totally grown up. She&#8217;s sending me emails, with old photos of myself attached, that say &#8220;I LOVE YOUR HAIR.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-563" alt="blond sarah" src="/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/blond-sarah.jpg" width="640" height="480" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/blond-sarah.jpg 640w, /wp-content/uploads/2013/08/blond-sarah-300x225.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">This is what happens when you work in a salon. Some days are slow, and you end up with blonde hair. It&#8217;s bizarre, right? I always wanted to try my hair like that though, so I went for it. Whoops! My dark eyebrows under there look TERRIBLE. I was like, &#8220;Madonna can pull off black eyebrows with platinum hair, why not me?&#8221; Why not you? Umm. I can think of lots of reasons, Past Sarah. How about, reason number one, you&#8217;re not Madonna. I can&#8217;t even believe I&#8217;m putting this picture on here. I&#8217;m clearly in a hotel, I&#8217;m not wearing makeup, and I look like a freak. The saddest part is, this is the best picture of me with my hair like this that I&#8217;ve ever seen. I don&#8217;t know where she got it! It&#8217;s weird to see old photos of yourself you&#8217;ve seen before, right? This blonde left my hair such a gross mess. I was always itchy because little pieces of hair were always breaking off, and when I&#8217;d wash it, it&#8217;d get wet and just streeeeeeetch and sort of semi-melt. My hair was thrashed. I do wish I&#8217;d taken the opportunity to dye it a bright blue though before I went back to a natural color. Missed that chance, Past Sarah! From getting in the car with strangers in Vegas, to not dyeing your hair a great color when you had a blank slate, to doing crystal, you always make the wrong decision! You&#8217;re a reeeeal fuck up, Past Sarah. Lucky for you, Present Sarah is very generous with her forgiveness, and willing to put the past behind her.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://instagram.com/p/c9nm2RrEmR/"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-564" alt="stila teaser" src="/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/stila-teaser.jpg" width="668" height="359" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/stila-teaser.jpg 668w, /wp-content/uploads/2013/08/stila-teaser-300x161.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 668px) 100vw, 668px" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Oh! My new Birchbox came this week, and it&#8217;s the best box yet. I got a full size eyeliner, a deluxe Stila lipstick sample, a hair product I&#8217;ve been dying to try, and a bunch of other cool stuff. I&#8217;ll try to have the full review for you guys on Monday. Until then, that&#8217;s a not great photo of the Stila color I got. I LOVE IT.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-565" alt="pool party rowdy" src="/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/pool-party-rowdy-1024x765.jpg" width="696" height="519" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/pool-party-rowdy-1024x765.jpg 1024w, /wp-content/uploads/2013/08/pool-party-rowdy-300x224.jpg 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2013/08/pool-party-rowdy-1272x950.jpg 1272w, /wp-content/uploads/2013/08/pool-party-rowdy.jpg 1600w" sizes="(max-width: 696px) 100vw, 696px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>CHILLIN</em></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">I took Rowdy to a friend&#8217;s house to go swimming the other day, and we had a great time! Turns out, she likes being in the pool! I held her, and all her little arms and legs were just floating in the water, while she had her eyes closed and her face turned towards the sun. When I tried to put her back on the concrete, she didn&#8217;t even try to help. She wanted to stay in the pool! She&#8217;s so crazy.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">For real though, the very best thing that happened this week was anÂ <strong>actual super awesome thing</strong>; <a href="http://flossgloss.com/">FLOSS GLOSS</a> retweeted one of my polish reviews. That&#8217;s the first time a beauty brand has done that, and it wasÂ <strong>VERY RAD</strong>!!!</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">What&#8217;s up with you guys this week? Did you have any past beauty experiments that you just had to get out of your system at least once? Is your past self a giant idiot too? Do you know which one of my smoke detectors is going off? HEY. WHAT&#8217;S GOING ON?</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>My &#8220;Hair&#8221; board on Pinterest is FULL of pictures like this:</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-200" alt="tease tease" src="/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/tease-tease.jpg" width="253" height="343" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/tease-tease.jpg 253w, /wp-content/uploads/2013/05/tease-tease-221x300.jpg 221w" sizes="(max-width: 253px) 100vw, 253px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Photo: <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/08/26/fashion/26Skin.html?_r=0">The New York Times</a></em></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Totally sexual and cool, big 60s hair is one of my very favorite styles.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">TOO BAD I COULDN&#8217;T TEASE MY HAIR IF MY LIFE DEPENDED ON IT.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">I&#8217;ve read countless tutorials, watched tons of videos, and even had my hairdresser/buddy show me how to do it on own head. Nothing ever helps! Sometimes, I&#8217;ll think I got it, but then I go to smooth hair over, and no, I don&#8217;t have it. I NEVER have it. I&#8217;ll tease and spray and tease and spray and it never works. I don&#8217;t know what I&#8217;m doing wrong, but whatever it is, it&#8217;s the key to undoing the entire thing.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">I can&#8217;t tell you how many times I&#8217;ve had to go with some other thrown together style at the last minute because I&#8217;m sweating and near tears, Jason is ready to go, and we&#8217;re late for a wedding, or whatever. It fucking sucks and it ruins my vision for my look.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">It&#8217;s especially frustrating because it seems like teasing is pretty basic. I can&#8217;t French braid either, so that ruins all the other hair ideas I have pinned. I&#8217;ll just be standing in front of the bathroom mirror, teasing or braiding, until my arms feel like they&#8217;re going to fall off, and the result is always the same; a head full of knots and a FURIOUS me.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">I&#8217;m not giving up though! I&#8217;m going to get it one day, dammit!</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">What about you? Are there any beauty styles or looks that you JUST CAN&#8217;T GET? Can you teach me to French braid? Should I just give it up and figure out another way to do my hair? Am I completely dumb for not being able to figure these things out?</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Let&#8217;s chat, darlings!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It&#8217;s been a long week for me down here at the old blog mill&#8230;</p>
<p>When you&#8217;re the boss of your own pretend job, it&#8217;s too easy to make yourself work unusual hours. Crazy, inhumane hours like, 2:30 AM &#8211; 6:00 AM, or 4:15 AM &#8211; 7:00 AM. Hours when I should be dreaming about doing it with Louis CK (more pleasant than you would think), or fighting with teenaged girls (exactly as horrible as you would think).</p>
<p>Also, I&#8217;ve been making some extra money working double time on the seduction line.</p>
<p>Needless to say, I&#8217;ve got a case of the Fridays. That&#8217;s like a case of the Mondays, except for instead of not wanting to do anything on a Monday, you don&#8217;t want to do anything on a Friday. I had a case of the Wednesdays too, but it was less severe.</p>

<p>Annnnyways. It was during one of those early morning blog shifts, when I was thinking about <a href="http://www.xojane.com/beauty/it-took-me-most-of-my-20s-to-look-halfway-decent">the post</a> I&#8217;d read about beauty mistakes we make while we&#8217;re first learning how to self style, that I got inspired me to write <a title="Accidental Throwback Thursday" href="/accidental-throwback-thursday/">a post</a> about my own cringeworthy mistakes. But, now, I want to know yours!</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">I know you guys were out there with crunchy hair and too much eyeliner.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-155" alt="tarareid" src="/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/tarareid.jpg" width="503" height="671" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/tarareid.jpg 503w, /wp-content/uploads/2013/05/tarareid-224x300.jpg 224w" sizes="(max-width: 503px) 100vw, 503px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">That loose boob is the best thing she has going on here.</p>
<p>Come on! Spill those beauty confessions!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>My first beauty memory is of being, like, 5 or 6, and sitting at my fancy grandma&#8217;s cosmetics littered vanity while she put straight gold glitter on my eyelids. She had tons of fur coats, red talon-like nails, a whole room for wigs, and I thought she was the most glamorous fucking thing I&#8217;d ever seen.</p>
<p>She wasn&#8217;t the best grandma, maternal instinct wise, but she was the best grandma at letting a 6 year old wear diamond rings and eat shrimp cocktail.</p>
<p>What&#8217;s your first beauty memory?</p>
