<p>Back in November, Melt Cosmetics released their newest shade, a juicy, plummy color named Dark Room. When the site went live with the product drop, it was a madhouse. Luckily, having survived the great Missoni for Target Frenzy of 2011, I was prepared. When the dust settled and the lipsticks were sold out, I had my tube, and all was right in my world. Kind of dumb to not buy two, but, I was really in the zone and I had my eyes on the prize.</p>
<p>If you missed the chance to jump on this color in November, it&#8217;s coming back in stock, and it&#8217;s going to be permanent.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-1123 size-large" src="/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Melt-Dark-Room-collage-1024x1024.jpg" alt="Melt Dark Room collage" width="696" height="696" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Melt-Dark-Room-collage-1024x1024.jpg 1024w, /wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Melt-Dark-Room-collage-150x150.jpg 150w, /wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Melt-Dark-Room-collage-300x300.jpg 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Melt-Dark-Room-collage-1272x1272.jpg 1272w, /wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Melt-Dark-Room-collage.jpg 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 696px) 100vw, 696px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Miss you, nails.</em></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Melt described this lipstick color as the inside of a beet, and that&#8217;s pretty accurate. It&#8217;s a really rich, sumptuous shade. I liked it best with multiple layers blotted down. It&#8217;s matte, and it wears really well. I did a friend&#8217;s makeup for her wedding, and we used it to give her a dramatic lip for the reception.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-1124 " src="/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Melt-Dark-Room-pics-1024x1024.jpg" alt="Melt Dark Room pics" width="647" height="647" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Melt-Dark-Room-pics-1024x1024.jpg 1024w, /wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Melt-Dark-Room-pics-150x150.jpg 150w, /wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Melt-Dark-Room-pics-300x300.jpg 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Melt-Dark-Room-pics-1272x1272.jpg 1272w, /wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Melt-Dark-Room-pics.jpg 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 647px) 100vw, 647px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>The babely bride and yours truly, wearing Dark Room. </em></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Dark Room will be back in stock on February 4th, so if you want it, get your credit card all cleaned, sharpened, and ready to go. From what I can tell, when Melt restocks, the supply doesn&#8217;t last long. Get out there and chase that lipstick! Have you ever experienced the rush of successfully snagging your coveted product during one of these madhouse cosmetics releases? It&#8217;s a very triumphant feeling. AND, 7-10 days later, there&#8217;s lipstick at your door! BONUS.</p>
