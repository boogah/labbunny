<p>Back in November, Melt Cosmetics released their newest shade, a juicy, plummy color named Dark Room. When the site went live with the product drop, it was a madhouse. Luckily, having survived the great Missoni for Target Frenzy of 2011, I was prepared. When the dust settled and the lipsticks were sold out, I had my tube, and all was right in my world. Kind of dumb to not buy two, but, I was really in the zone and I had my eyes on the prize.</p>
<p>If you missed the chance to jump on this color in November, it&#8217;s coming back in stock, and it&#8217;s going to be permanent.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-1123 size-large" src="/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Melt-Dark-Room-collage-1024x1024.jpg" alt="Melt Dark Room collage" width="696" height="696" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Melt-Dark-Room-collage-1024x1024.jpg 1024w, /wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Melt-Dark-Room-collage-150x150.jpg 150w, /wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Melt-Dark-Room-collage-300x300.jpg 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Melt-Dark-Room-collage-1272x1272.jpg 1272w, /wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Melt-Dark-Room-collage.jpg 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 696px) 100vw, 696px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Miss you, nails.</em></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Melt described this lipstick color as the inside of a beet, and that&#8217;s pretty accurate. It&#8217;s a really rich, sumptuous shade. I liked it best with multiple layers blotted down. It&#8217;s matte, and it wears really well. I did a friend&#8217;s makeup for her wedding, and we used it to give her a dramatic lip for the reception.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-1124 " src="/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Melt-Dark-Room-pics-1024x1024.jpg" alt="Melt Dark Room pics" width="647" height="647" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Melt-Dark-Room-pics-1024x1024.jpg 1024w, /wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Melt-Dark-Room-pics-150x150.jpg 150w, /wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Melt-Dark-Room-pics-300x300.jpg 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Melt-Dark-Room-pics-1272x1272.jpg 1272w, /wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Melt-Dark-Room-pics.jpg 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 647px) 100vw, 647px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>The babely bride and yours truly, wearing Dark Room. </em></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Dark Room will be back in stock on February 4th, so if you want it, get your credit card all cleaned, sharpened, and ready to go. From what I can tell, when Melt restocks, the supply doesn&#8217;t last long. Get out there and chase that lipstick! Have you ever experienced the rush of successfully snagging your coveted product during one of these madhouse cosmetics releases? It&#8217;s a very triumphant feeling. AND, 7-10 days later, there&#8217;s lipstick at your door! BONUS.</p>

<p><strong>AUUUUUUUUUGGGGGGGGGGGHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</strong></p>
<p>MAC announced the Rocky Horror Fall collection, and I am SHIVERING WITH ANTICI&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">PATION!</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">I see a nail polish, a lipstick, and a couple glitters or pigments that I&#8217;m going to need. The collection drops online September 29th, and in stores on October 2nd. Lucky for me, that&#8217;s just a few days before my birthday! I think the traditional 33rd birthday present is Dr. Frank-N-Furter themed lipstick, so this works out great!</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><a href="http://www.temptalia.com/mac-x-rocky-horror-picture-show-collection-fall-2014">Temptalia has the full details, and photos. Go up to the lab, and see what&#8217;s on the slab! Check it out! </a></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The UD Spring 2014 line started hitting the internet this morning, and it&#8217;s pretty tame. I guess that&#8217;s ok. I just don&#8217;t get all crazy about sheer finishing powders. Don&#8217;t get me wrong! I love finding a beautiful new face product, but it&#8217;s less impactful in preview photos. Show me an orange lipstick or a hot pink blush, and then you&#8217;ve really got me excited!</p>
<p>I was hopeful when I saw there was lipgloss, but they&#8217;re all so sheer, and so similar, they all look alike on the lip. They&#8217;re pretty, but all the pictures I&#8217;ve seen this morning, had me like, &#8220;Oh. That&#8217;s nice.&#8221; I *am* interested in what the formula feels like, and it&#8217;s always good to have a nice nude gloss in your bag, so I might eventually grab one. But, I&#8217;m not in a big hurry. We&#8217;ll see. I didn&#8217;t think I was in a big hurry to get the Naked3 palette, but I still scooped it up the second it was available.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.temptalia.com/urban-decay-naked-ultra-nourishing-lipgloss-round">Check out Temptalia&#8217;s round up <strong>HERE</strong>.</a></p>
<p><a href="http://www.musingsofamuse.com/2014/01/urban-decay-naked-ultra-nourishing-lipgloss-review-swatches.html">The Muse&#8217;s swatches are <strong>HERE</strong>.</a></p>
<p>These aren&#8217;t actually available to buy until tomorrow. As much as I wish for it, I don&#8217;t get preview PR product. Probably because there are a million beauty blogs and I&#8217;ve only been doing this one since last May. And also probably because I only got out of bed long enough this morning to drink a Starbucks, and then I went back to bed until 12:30. NO KIDS, NO JOB, NOWHERE TO BE. ZZZZZZZZZ&#8230;.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I&#8217;m not a black Friday shopper. Going to stand in line in the cold, after I&#8217;ve stuffed myself with Thanksgiving sounds so terrible. I can only assume that the entire area out in front of Best Buy, on Thursday night, smells like turkey farts. Maybe some people are into that kind of thing, but I ain&#8217;t. It doesn&#8217;t sound fun, it sounds like my nightmare. So, yeah. I won&#8217;t do that.</p>
<p>What I will do is set my alarm for 5:45 AM, drop my phone trying to shut off the alarm, get out of bed, stumble into my office, and fight other beauty aficionados online for a piece of a limited supply of heavily discounted lipstick. All with my boobs out. That&#8217;s what I did on Friday morning, and I was able to score one of Urban Decay&#8217;s insane black Friday deals. They had a bundle of six of their gorgeous Revolution lipsticks on sale for $50!! That&#8217;s $132 worth of lipstick for $50!! I&#8217;m getting lightheaded just remembering it. Apparently, there was a super short supply of this deal. I don&#8217;t know how I was able to make it happen, but I did. I&#8217;m like one of those people at Target who manages to get one of the two $60 big screen TVs, right? Everyone tries to get them, but nobody can get them. Well, I got the makeup equivalent of that. Eat it, everyone else! I&#8217;m a champion! Also, I&#8217;m a sore winner. Everyone else doesn&#8217;t have to eat it, but I&#8217;m still a champion. I actually do feel bad for the people who weren&#8217;t able to get this bundle. I know what that feels like, it&#8217;s frustrating.</p>
<p>I also got a TON of stuff from <a href="http://www.coastalscents.com/">Coastal Scents</a>. I haven&#8217;t tried anything from them yet, but everyone else seems to be a fan. I picked up a bunch of 99 cent eyeshadows, discounted brushes, and a palette to hold the shadows. That sale is still going on. Everything on their site is 50% off. So, it&#8217;s a good time to grab crazy colored shadows you might not risk otherwise and stock up on brushes.</p>
<p>Floss Gloss was having a sale on Friday night, and I was finally able to pick up their Selena tribute color! I&#8217;ve been whimpering about this polish ever since they released it a couple weeks ago. I can&#8217;t wait to try it! They&#8217;re having a <a href="http://flossgloss.com/">Cyber Monday sale today</a>, so if you&#8217;ve been a fan of any of the colors I&#8217;ve swatched here, today is a good day to grab them for 30% off.</p>
<p>Whew! I was on a rampage! My credit card is smoking! Look for alllll this and more coming up soon! Also, look for my beautiful face shining upon all of you when I get all this new stuff in. I can&#8217;t wait for it to start showing up. The FedEx truck pulls up, and I get goosebumps. In my bra. Haha! Just kidding! I&#8217;m not wearing a bra! DOWN WITH BIG UNDERWIRE!</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">What do you guys think? Do you want it? I&#8217;m sort of on the fence. I&#8217;m not crazy about how rosy all the shades look in the pan, but I&#8217;ll have to see it in person to be sure. It&#8217;s going to be tough to pass it up. I&#8217;ve been able to mostly squelch my addiction to buying UD palettes, but these Naked products keep callin&#8217; my name!</p>

<p>MAC has brought back their original burgundy-red Viva Glam lipstick from 1994! With original Viva Glam SUPERMODEL OF THE WORLD, RuPaul!</p>
<p>I actually don&#8217;t have any of the Viva Glam lipsticks, but, I think the beginning is probably a good place to start. I&#8217;m into it! Ru is my Oprah, and as a person from the 90s, I have a deep understanding of burgundy lipsticks.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m going to buy it without even trying it on, because I know it doesn&#8217;t matter what I do, everything looks good on me. Supermodel.</p>
<p>Speaking of Ru and Supermodel, when was the last time you watched the &#8220;Supermodel&#8221; video?</p>
<p>http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vw9LOrHU8JI</p>
<p>Ru is everydamnthang in this video! She&#8217;s so fucking funny, it kills me! And the shout outs to all the 90&#8217;s Supermodels? LAWD, that makes my Evangelista loving heart skip a beat.</p>
<p>The 90&#8217;s were an amazing time. If you need more proof of this, allow me to take you to my happy place:</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-627" alt="ru and nirvana" src="/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/ru-and-nirvana.jpg" width="403" height="600" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/ru-and-nirvana.jpg 403w, /wp-content/uploads/2013/09/ru-and-nirvana-201x300.jpg 201w" sizes="(max-width: 403px) 100vw, 403px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>I just might make this my iphone screen.</em></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Feel free to use it as your happy place too. Whenever you feel bad, just do a Google image search for the Ru and Nirvana. There are all kinds of photos! Ru holding a crying Frances Bean and trying to console her?! DEAD. I AM DEAD NOW.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Am I off topic? We were talking about Viva Glam. We can talk about the 90s any time. We can talk about RuPaul all the time, if you want. I mean, I&#8217;ve been thinking about hugging her since 1993. True Story: Ru tweeted back to me once about Miss J, from ANTM, and I got dizzy. Worlds were colliding and I couldn&#8217;t take it.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><a href="http://www.maccosmetics.com/whats_new/11404/New-Collections/Viva-Glam-The-Original/index.tmpl">Buy Viva Glam The Original HERE. Every cent of the selling price ($15) goes towards helping people living with HIV/AIDS.</a></p>
