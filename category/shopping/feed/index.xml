<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://www.tokyo-milk.com/products/la-vie-la-mort-no-90-shea-butter-handcreme"><em>TokyoMilk, $22</em></a></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">I&#8217;m such a sucker for packaging. Look at that little black tube! Isn&#8217;t that the sexiest looking hand cream you&#8217;ve ever seen?</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">The circumstances that led to my purchasing this hand cream were kind of a perfect storm. I&#8217;ve been working really hard to stop chewing and picking at my cuticles and the skin around my fingers, part of that is keeping my hands lotioned up; I just ran out of my Love + Toast hand lotion, and I got an email notifying me of some credits sitting in some random account on some random shopping site, that I&#8217;d immediately forgotten about as soon as I&#8217;d signed up.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">I went to the site, <a href="http://www.luvocracy.com/">luvocracy.com</a>, to see what I could buy, and I found sort of a shoppable Pinterest. It&#8217;s cool! I searched for &#8220;hand cream&#8221; and a bunch of options popped up. You buy directly through them, and then they search the internet for a cheaper price or lower shipping on the same product, and if they find one, you pay that reduced price. I&#8217;d long been curious about this brand, so I bought it, and a couple days later I got an email letting me know they&#8217;d found it for $5 cheaper than what I was originally going to pay. I&#8217;m ALWAYS into that.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">My delivery was fast, and it came in a pretty black box, all tied up with black ribbon from Barney&#8217;s. The lotion itself is totally gorgeous. Silky, lush, and heavily scented with white tuberose, cardamom, hibiscus leaf and jasmine, it&#8217;s such a fancy little luxury! I love it! Little beautiful things like that make me so happy.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Go to <a href="http://www.luvocracy.com/">the site</a> to sign up, or leave a comment and I&#8217;ll send you an invite, you&#8217;ll get a $10 credit, and you can try it for yourself!</p>
