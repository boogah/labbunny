<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Witch-ay Woman</em></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">A commenter asked about the other makeup I&#8217;m wearing in this photo from <a title="OCC Lip Tar All-Star Mini x 4 Set: Anime &amp; Black Dahlia" href="/occ-lip-tar-star-mini-x-4-set-anime-black-dahlia/">my review of the OCC Lip Tar All-Star Mini set</a>. I was like, duh, I should probably start including that information along with my photos. I guess I probably never thought about it because I am the worst and I like to keep all my secrets to myself. Like, if you gush about my sunglasses and ask where I got them, I&#8217;ll tell you&#8211;but, inside, I really don&#8217;t want to. I know. That&#8217;s terrible. And it&#8217;s not even the grossest thing about me. Don&#8217;t worry, I get karma back on it. A couple months ago, I asked a lady at the farmers market where she got her sunglasses, and she was all, &#8220;I don&#8217;t remember.&#8221; And I was like, &#8220;Girl. Yeah, right.&#8221; It&#8217;s like Justin Timberlake says, &#8220;What goes around, goes around, goes around, comes all the way back around.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">So, the makeup in this picture!</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Eyes &#8211; It looks like I used three shadows for this look. From the original Urban Decay Naked palette, I used &#8220;Virgin&#8221; for the brow bone and &#8220;Half Baked&#8221; for the inner eye corners. The bulk of the shadow, the wine color, is from a very old TIGI Cosmetics palette. I tried to find it, and unfortunately, it doesn&#8217;t look like they make it anymore. I swear this is not me just trying not to tell. I bough the palette when I was in beauty school a million years ago, and I probably shouldn&#8217;t even be using it anymore. The color was just called, &#8220;Wine,&#8221; and it&#8217;s not very hard to dupe; any wine color that leans more towards a plum will do the trick. I used a white pencil liner from the Sephora collection on my lower waterline, and UD&#8217;s black pencil liner on my bottom lash line and upper waterline. The mascara is Benefit&#8217;s They&#8217;re Real.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Eyebrows &#8211; Anastasia Beverly Hills Brow Powder Duo in &#8220;Brunette/Dark Brown&#8221; is my go to brow product. I use a light mixture of the two colors on a thin angled brush.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Blush &#8211; &#8220;Peaches&#8221; Sheertone Blush by MAC.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Lips &#8211; OCC Lip Tar in &#8220;Black Dahlia&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">There you have it! I guess I really don&#8217;t mind telling about makeup and beauty stuff. I mean, if I did, I probably wouldn&#8217;t have started a beauty blog. So, the good news is, my shadiness only extends to accessories! The bad news is, I will never ever start a sunglasses and bracelets blog.</p>

<p style="text-align: left;"><a title="OCC Lip Tar All-Star Mini x 4 Set: Memento &amp; NSFW" href="/occ-lip-tar-star-mini-x-4-set-memento-nsfw/">Yesterday, I told you about this exclusive to Sephora set of OCC Lip Tars.</a>  Four of OCC&#8217;s amazing Lip Tars in the perfect size, at a great price. Long wearing, deeply pigmented, super sexy, ultra awesome liquid lipstick for only $20!</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter  wp-image-725" alt="occ lip tar sampler" src="/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/occ-lip-tar-sampler-1024x768.jpg" width="557" height="418" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/occ-lip-tar-sampler-1024x768.jpg 1024w, /wp-content/uploads/2013/11/occ-lip-tar-sampler-300x225.jpg 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2013/11/occ-lip-tar-sampler-1272x954.jpg 1272w" sizes="(max-width: 557px) 100vw, 557px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">I showed you the neutral pink and the primary red yesterday. Let&#8217;s finish up the set!</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="aligncenter  wp-image-736" alt="occ lip tar set arm swatch 2" src="/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/occ-lip-tar-set-arm-swatch-2-1024x845.jpg" width="557" height="459" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/occ-lip-tar-set-arm-swatch-2-1024x845.jpg 1024w, /wp-content/uploads/2013/11/occ-lip-tar-set-arm-swatch-2-300x247.jpg 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2013/11/occ-lip-tar-set-arm-swatch-2-1272x1049.jpg 1272w, /wp-content/uploads/2013/11/occ-lip-tar-set-arm-swatch-2.jpg 1621w" sizes="(max-width: 557px) 100vw, 557px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Anime is a hot, blue based fuchsia, so I was in love right away. It&#8217;s a vibrant, bubblegum pink that&#8217;s eye catching and bright.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="aligncenter  wp-image-733" alt="occ lip tar set anime" src="/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/occ-lip-tar-set-anime-768x1024.jpg" width="557" height="742" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/occ-lip-tar-set-anime-768x1024.jpg 768w, /wp-content/uploads/2013/11/occ-lip-tar-set-anime-225x300.jpg 225w, /wp-content/uploads/2013/11/occ-lip-tar-set-anime.jpg 960w" sizes="(max-width: 557px) 100vw, 557px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Anime has great coverage, and it doesn&#8217;t crease or show lines when you press your lips together. The color was easy to work with, it applied beautifully and left a pretty stain. I loved this color! I definitely see myself wearing it often. A bright lip like this is more wearable than people think. It looks pretty and unobtrusive when you pair it with a light eye.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Black Dahlia is a deep, blackened red. It&#8217;s a beautiful wine color that&#8217;s great for fall and winter. I was super into this color, and it inspired me to create a whole witchy look.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="aligncenter  wp-image-734" alt="occ lip tar set black dahlia" src="/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/occ-lip-tar-set-black-dahlia-768x1024.jpg" width="557" height="742" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/occ-lip-tar-set-black-dahlia-768x1024.jpg 768w, /wp-content/uploads/2013/11/occ-lip-tar-set-black-dahlia-225x300.jpg 225w, /wp-content/uploads/2013/11/occ-lip-tar-set-black-dahlia.jpg 960w" sizes="(max-width: 557px) 100vw, 557px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">DO YOU LOVE IT?! I love it! It looks so much darker in the tube, but on the lip, it was much lighter. Black Dahlia was the most difficult to work with out of the set. The color moves around quite a bit, and it will settle into lines and cracks. A little patience and a steady hand with the little brush will get you through. <strong>Remember dark colors will make your lips look smaller. </strong>If this is a concern for you, blot the color down and/or use a concealer or highlighter color on your cupid&#8217;s bow, above your lips, to make your lips look fuller.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">To get the best results out of your Lip Tars, be sure to <a title="Lip Prep School" href="/lip-prep-school/">prep your lips</a> before you wear them. You&#8217;ll get a smoother application and better wear time if your lips are lookin&#8217; and feelin&#8217; right.  I try to keep my lips prepped at all times. You never know when you&#8217;re going to be in an emergency that calls for your well hydrated and exfoliated lips to look on point! YOU LITERALLY NEVER KNOW.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="aligncenter  wp-image-737" alt="Screen Shot 2013-11-08 at 8.37.18 AM" src="/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/Screen-Shot-2013-11-08-at-8.37.18-AM.png" width="629" height="413" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/Screen-Shot-2013-11-08-at-8.37.18-AM.png 874w, /wp-content/uploads/2013/11/Screen-Shot-2013-11-08-at-8.37.18-AM-300x197.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 629px) 100vw, 629px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>I figured out a way to show scale! DUH!</em></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">I think this set is a really great buy. Crazy long wearing, you only need a tiny amount, and the price all combine to make an amazing deal. This is an excellent starter set for anyone new to OCC&#8217;s Lip Tars. I&#8217;m totally thrilled they made it, and I hope they do the entire Lip Tar collection in this size!</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://www.sephora.com/lip-tar-all-star-mini-x-4-set-P383463?icid2=ObsessiveCompulsive_Sets_Carousel_P383463_link"><em>Sephora, $20</em></a></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Well, this is freaking brilliant.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">This set is proof positive that dreams really do come true! Ever since I bought my first Lip Tar, I&#8217;ve wished for a smaller, cheaper tube. The pigment in their formula is so intense, a tiny bit goes a really long way! How was I ever going to finish a tube?</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="aligncenter  wp-image-725" alt="occ lip tar sampler" src="/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/occ-lip-tar-sampler-1024x768.jpg" width="557" height="418" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/occ-lip-tar-sampler-1024x768.jpg 1024w, /wp-content/uploads/2013/11/occ-lip-tar-sampler-300x225.jpg 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2013/11/occ-lip-tar-sampler-1272x954.jpg 1272w" sizes="(max-width: 557px) 100vw, 557px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>L-R: Memento, NSFW, Anime, Black Dahlia</em></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">The tubes in this set are small, 0.08 oz each, and they&#8217;re exactly what I wanted! Large enough to be useful, but small enough to feel like I didn&#8217;t pay for a ton of wasted product. I&#8217;m trying to show scale here with my little paw, but, you have no idea how big my hands are! Let me just say that the iPhone is almost getting too tall for my hands now. Does that help? The colors are good for a wide range of looks, and I think they show the vibrancy of the OCC Lip Tar formula really well. This set is a Sephora exclusive, and at $20 for four small tubes, when a full size tube is $18, it&#8217;s a really great deal.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">To me, these four colors seem really accessible &#8211; they&#8217;re a good choice for anyone new to the line. They might seem really bright, but they can be easily blotted down. Besides, come on! Live a little! Are you going to go your whole life without wearing some insane lipstick? Brother, that ain&#8217;t livin&#8217;.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">We&#8217;ll do two colors today, and two colors tomorrow. Starting with, what I think, are the two most useful colors, Memento and NSFW.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="aligncenter  wp-image-738" alt="occ lip tar set swatch 1" src="/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/occ-lip-tar-set-swatch-1-1024x873.jpg" width="557" height="474" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/occ-lip-tar-set-swatch-1-1024x873.jpg 1024w, /wp-content/uploads/2013/11/occ-lip-tar-set-swatch-1-300x255.jpg 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2013/11/occ-lip-tar-set-swatch-1-1272x1084.jpg 1272w, /wp-content/uploads/2013/11/occ-lip-tar-set-swatch-1.jpg 1486w" sizes="(max-width: 557px) 100vw, 557px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Memento is a neutral, medium pink/plum. It&#8217;s bright, and sweet, and it would be a really beautiful day to day color.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="aligncenter  wp-image-726" alt="occ lip tar sampler 1" src="/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/occ-lip-tar-sampler-1-768x1024.jpg" width="557" height="742" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/occ-lip-tar-sampler-1-768x1024.jpg 768w, /wp-content/uploads/2013/11/occ-lip-tar-sampler-1-225x300.jpg 225w, /wp-content/uploads/2013/11/occ-lip-tar-sampler-1.jpg 960w" sizes="(max-width: 557px) 100vw, 557px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">You could wear this color with so many looks, in so many different settings. It&#8217;s versatile, and the most wearable of the four colors.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">NSFW is a balanced, true primary red. This color means business and it is GORGEOUS. I have a super special place in my heart for red lipstick, and NSFW is about as straight up red lipstick as it gets.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="aligncenter  wp-image-727" alt="occ lip tar sampler 2" src="/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/occ-lip-tar-sampler-2-768x1024.jpg" width="557" height="742" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/occ-lip-tar-sampler-2-768x1024.jpg 768w, /wp-content/uploads/2013/11/occ-lip-tar-sampler-2-225x300.jpg 225w, /wp-content/uploads/2013/11/occ-lip-tar-sampler-2.jpg 960w" sizes="(max-width: 557px) 100vw, 557px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Red lipstick makes me feel like everyone should look at me. ALL HAIL MY POWER COLOR. Red lipstick is my can of spinach. I put it on, and my beauty muscles pump up! I even commandeered my own attention in the mirror in this color. I&#8217;ll tell you this, I was very compelled to take a ton of pictures of myself wearing NSFW.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="aligncenter  wp-image-728" alt="occ lip tar sampler diptic" src="/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/occ-lip-tar-sampler-diptic-1024x1024.jpg" width="557" height="557" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/occ-lip-tar-sampler-diptic-1024x1024.jpg 1024w, /wp-content/uploads/2013/11/occ-lip-tar-sampler-diptic-150x150.jpg 150w, /wp-content/uploads/2013/11/occ-lip-tar-sampler-diptic-300x300.jpg 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2013/11/occ-lip-tar-sampler-diptic-1272x1272.jpg 1272w, /wp-content/uploads/2013/11/occ-lip-tar-sampler-diptic.jpg 1632w" sizes="(max-width: 557px) 100vw, 557px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">ONLY GOD CAN JUDGE ME.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Let she who is without a thousand pictures of her own face in her phone cast the first stone. There&#8217;s a reason that self facing camera is there, ok?</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">As usual, you&#8217;ll get hours of wear time from these Lip Tars. They stain like crazy, so if you don&#8217;t use a slow and steady hand WITH the recommended tiny bead of product, you could very easily end up looking like some dirty, Kool-Aid mouthed hillbilly child. That&#8217;s not a cute look. We want super sexy confidence power mouth, not &#8220;nobody cleans my face and I think Kool-Aid is the same as juice&#8221; mouth.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Part two tomorrow!</p>

<p>I tried <a href="http://www.occmakeup.com/store/cart.php?cat=LIP+TAR%3A+PRETTY+BOY">OCC Lip Tar in Pretty Boy</a> ($18), yesterday, and LOOK HOW HAPPY IT MADE ME! This is pretty much one of my very favorite lip colors, in general. Give me the opportunity, and I&#8217;ll pick a blue based fuchsia 9 times out of 10. I&#8217;m drawn to them like they&#8217;re bearded dudes with forearm tattoos, or chihuahuas with big ears, or my couch.</p>
<p>The couch that&#8217;s right there, in my line of vision, totally empty, just all alone and sad&#8230;</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve been neglecting the couch all week. That&#8217;s so sad when you&#8217;re close to someone and you just start to grow apart&#8230;</p>
<p>WHOA WHERE WAS I? My mind control is too strong and I just hypnotized myself thinking about the couch while I listened to &#8220;Still D.R.E.&#8221; I got all in a couch/Dre mindfreak. Yikes.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s like when you find yourself slipping into sleep without any dreams, just darkness, and you snap awake realizing how easy it would be to just die one day.</p>
<p>You guys know what I mean?</p>
<p>WHOA WHERE WAS I AGAIN?</p>
<p>Lip Tar will keep us all together here, back to Lip Tar.</p>
<p>OCC really has a fantastic lip product in these Lip Tars. Pretty Boy is a gorgeous &#8220;super rich fuchsia,&#8221; that looks really great as a satin finish on its own, or so obscenely sexy with a shiny gloss over it. I&#8217;m wearing it above with just a quick swipe of my <a title="Lip Prep School" href="/lip-prep-school/">Fresh Sugar Lip Treatment</a> over the top to keep my lips hydrated.</p>
<p>The color stayed on until I removed it myself, so it wore just like I&#8217;d expect from this product.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m going to go back to Sephora to buy it for my collection.</p>
<p>After I spend some time with my couch, obviously. I don&#8217;t want to cause some kind of &#8220;Cat&#8217;s in the Cradle&#8221; situation between us, I&#8217;m not an unfeeling monster.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><em>OCC Lip Tar in Queen, $18</em></p>
<p><a href="http://www.occmakeup.com/lips.html">These OCC Lip Tars</a> are some serious shit.</p>
<p>I wasn&#8217;t sure what to expect when I bought this color. In the store, it looked peachier, but at home, it was much pinker. Queen is described as a &#8220;bright coral pink,&#8221; and that&#8217;s pretty accurate. It&#8217;s bright pink, but it doesn&#8217;t have enough purple in it to be fuchsia. My BFF and I tried it together when I opened it for the first time, at home, and it was so cool and fun there were actual squeals of delight (she gives it her Sam&#8217;s Seal of Approval, btw).</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-231" alt="liptarqueen2" src="/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/liptarqueen2-768x1024.jpg" width="696" height="928" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/liptarqueen2-768x1024.jpg 768w, /wp-content/uploads/2013/05/liptarqueen2-225x300.jpg 225w, /wp-content/uploads/2013/05/liptarqueen2.jpg 960w" sizes="(max-width: 696px) 100vw, 696px" /></p>
<p>Even though I was expecting a different color, I was happy with how it came out. It&#8217;s a really great Spring/Summer color.</p>
<p>The staying power makes it great for summer too.</p>
<p>I tested how it held up to heat and heavy sweating while I was trying on clothes at the mall just now. Does everyone else totally sweathog it in the dressing rooms like I do? I don&#8217;t know if it&#8217;s the lights or the pressure or what, but the second I start pulling my clothes off, I become a thousand degrees. So then I&#8217;m trying to pull pants legs over my shoes, and my hair is sticking to my forehead, and OH MY GOD IS THAT WHAT I LOOK LIKE FROM BEHIND, all while Chris Farley level sweat is springing out of my upper lip. Usually, I end up wiping my lipstick off so it doesn&#8217;t smear, but that wasn&#8217;t a concern today. The Lips Tars don&#8217;t go anywhere.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-232" alt="queen" src="/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/queen-300x229.jpg" width="300" height="229" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/queen-300x229.jpg 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2013/05/queen.jpg 491w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">This is after about 5 hours of wear. Eating, drinking, swearing, etc.</p>
<p>When applying Lip Tar, you put a tiny dot of color onto the enclosed lip brush, and paint from the center of your lips out. If you put your little drop of Lip Tar on your brush, and you think, &#8220;I don&#8217;t know. That doesn&#8217;t seem like enough,&#8221; it&#8217;s probably enough. Trust me, it&#8217;s better to just start out with less than you think you&#8217;ll need, a little bit of Lip Tar goes a <strong>really</strong> long way. Their site warns against using too much and running the risk or your lip color feathering. That&#8217;s Gangie status right there.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-229" alt="Lucillegif" src="/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Lucillegif.gif" width="245" height="245" /></p>
<p>Not that Gangie would ever let her lipstick feather. But you know what I mean, feathered lip lines are for old ladies.</p>
<p>OCC Lip Tars apply like a gloss, but they dry down to a NOT STICKY satin lipstick type finish. You can build from a stain to full coverage very easily, and they&#8217;re so heavily pigmented, that every level of application has vivid color payoff. Although they do dry, they are non-drying to your lips. Most long wear lipsticks and glosses make your mouth feel gross when they dry, but the Lip Tar left my mouth feeling like, well, like my mouth. There are 46 colors, and they&#8217;re made for mixing. The possibilities are extraordinary!</p>
<p>I&#8217;m so in love with these Lip Tars now. I want to buy all 46 colors, scatter them all over our bed, and do it on them!</p>
