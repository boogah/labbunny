<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Lips: Pink Velvet by Lime Crime</em></p>
<p>Look at your girl! She got up on time this morning, and worked it out for y&#8217;all! I didn&#8217;t just do makeup, oh no. I made a hair tutorial, too.</p>
<p>WHO AM I?!?!?</p>
<p>I&#8217;m the shit.</p>
<p>What I&#8217;m not, is a good hair doer. Like, these big donut buns have eluded me because my hair is sort of short and full of layers. That was a bummer because I do love a bun. All bunz. Lucky for me, laziness and frustration breeds ingenuity, and I figured out a way to make it happen without all the arm killing rolling, and without my layers sticking out everywhere.</p>
<p>Since I&#8217;m not big on hair that takes a lot of time and effort, this tutorial is suuuuper easy. Like, the whole thing will take you less than five minutes. All you need is two big hair ties (rubber bands?), a hair donut, and a bunch of bobby pins. CHECK IT OUT.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>STEP ONE</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1010" src="/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/step_1_sm.gif" alt="step_1_sm" width="480" height="270" /></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Pull your hair up into a high ponytail, securing it with a rubber band. Pin up any stragglers that fall down in the back. Then, pull your ponytail through the donut, and settle it against your head. Make sure you use a larger donut, since we won&#8217;t have the volume you get from rolling all the hair into it.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>STEP TWO</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1011" src="/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/step_2_sm.gif" alt="step_2_sm" width="480" height="270" /></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Pull the hair from your ponytail down over the donut. Making sure to evenly spread it all the way around the donut, so none of the mesh is showing.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>STEP THREE</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1012" src="/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/step_3_sm.gif" alt="step_3_sm" width="480" height="270" /></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Take another large rubber band and pop it over the donut to hold the hair in place where you want it. As you can see, sometimes this takes a couple tries to get the right angle. Make sure everything is smooth, even, and covering the donut.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>STEP FOUR</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1013" src="/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/step_4_sm.gif" alt="step_4_sm" width="480" height="270" /></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Pull the ends of the hair around the rubber band to cover it, pinning it in place as you go. If you need to, you can stick pins up into the donut. It&#8217;s super easy.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1014" src="/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/step_5_sm.gif" alt="step_5_sm" width="480" height="270" /></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Pin the hair all the way around, adjusting the bun as you go to make sure everything is exactly where you want it. After that, I like to pull a little hair down in front of my ears just to soften it up. But, that&#8217;s up to you.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">And that&#8217;s it!! It&#8217;s so easy!</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1015" src="/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/donut-bun-2.jpg" alt="donut bun 2" width="480" height="640" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/donut-bun-2.jpg 480w, /wp-content/uploads/2014/06/donut-bun-2-225x300.jpg 225w" sizes="(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">I like to add a little something extra around the bun, just to make everything look super correct. This is my new <a href="http://www.shopbando.com/product/bando-twist-scarf?display=1836">twist scarf from ban.do</a>. It has wire inside it, so it pretty much does whatever I want it to do. You can use whatever; scarves, necklaces, bracelets, cute pins or barrettes. I&#8217;d say the possibilities are endless, but that&#8217;s probably not right. You know what I mean, GO CRAZY!</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Was this a revelation for anyone else?! I was so excited when I figured it out!! My normal messy bun isn&#8217;t always appropriate for all outfits and occasions. This new option is pretty great.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">I hope you guys like it! Let me know!!</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><em><a href="http://limecrime.com/lips/velvetines-37.html">Pink Velvet, Lime Crime, $20</a>, <a href="http://quayeyeware.com.au/collections/product-category/penelopy/">Penelopy, Quay Australia, $39.95</a></em></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">I got a shopping email this morning about bathing suits. This was very stressful for me because it is February, and I was under the assumption that I had at least four more months to lose a million pounds and find totally new thighs before I had to think about swimming attire. What does this mean for swimsuit options in June? And why did I eat all that bread this afternoon? Â What will become of the rest of the bread?</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">SPOILER ALERT: I STILL EAT THE BREAD.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">So, ok. I&#8217;m not ready for a swimsuit yet. I&#8217;m ready to think about other summer related things though! Hence the sunglasses. I was just going to lie and say that I was doing a post about makeup and I decided to throw the sunglasses on for fun. Actually, I just wanted to take pictures of my sunglasses. I&#8217;ll come clean. This is a safe space, right? I really like to look at myself when I&#8217;m wearing these sunglasses, so I paired them with something else I obsess about in the mirror; my Velvetine liquid lipstick from Lime Crime in Pink Velvet.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="aligncenter  wp-image-925" alt="Lime Crime Pink Velvet Tube" src="/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/Lime-Crime-Pink-Velvet-Tube.jpg" width="614" height="609" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/Lime-Crime-Pink-Velvet-Tube.jpg 1280w, /wp-content/uploads/2014/02/Lime-Crime-Pink-Velvet-Tube-150x150.jpg 150w, /wp-content/uploads/2014/02/Lime-Crime-Pink-Velvet-Tube-300x297.jpg 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2014/02/Lime-Crime-Pink-Velvet-Tube-1024x1014.jpg 1024w, /wp-content/uploads/2014/02/Lime-Crime-Pink-Velvet-Tube-1272x1260.jpg 1272w" sizes="(max-width: 614px) 100vw, 614px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="aligncenter  wp-image-926" alt="Lime Crime Pink Velvet swatch" src="/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/Lime-Crime-Pink-Velvet-swatch.jpg" width="614" height="481" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/Lime-Crime-Pink-Velvet-swatch.jpg 1280w, /wp-content/uploads/2014/02/Lime-Crime-Pink-Velvet-swatch-300x234.jpg 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2014/02/Lime-Crime-Pink-Velvet-swatch-1024x801.jpg 1024w, /wp-content/uploads/2014/02/Lime-Crime-Pink-Velvet-swatch-1272x995.jpg 1272w" sizes="(max-width: 614px) 100vw, 614px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">This lip product is so rad! It goes on almost like a gloss, but it dries like a stain. I guess you can sort of compare it to how the OCC Lip Tars work, but Pink Velvet isn&#8217;t as gooey. It starts out a thin, glossy liquid, but it&#8217;s fully opaque in two coats and it dries totally matte.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-923" alt="pink velvet lips" src="/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/pink-velvet-lips.jpg" width="341" height="273" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/pink-velvet-lips.jpg 341w, /wp-content/uploads/2014/02/pink-velvet-lips-300x240.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 341px) 100vw, 341px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Pink Velvet dries quickly, and once it does, it feels almost nonexistent on the lips. Similar liquid lip products can make your lips feel sticky or all scratchy. This just doesn&#8217;t really feel like anything. That&#8217;s not to say it&#8217;s moisturizing in any way, it&#8217;s not. But, it doesn&#8217;t make your lips all dry and flaky. Besides being totally sexy, the matte finish is also SUPER long wearing. It will last through pretty much anything! I&#8217;ve even had a difficult time trying to remove it on purpose. So, maybe don&#8217;t just rub at it forever with toilet paper, you&#8217;ll stain the area around your mouth pink and you&#8217;ll definitely get toilet paper lint on your tongue. Take it from me, a little vaseline or some oil will take it right off. I use my <a title="My Skin System" href="/skin-system/">Badger Damascus Rose Oil</a> to remove it. The oil cleans off my lipstick and it adds some hydration to my lips. It&#8217;s a pretty good system, if I do say so myself.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">I really love this product. I want the red Velvetine and I am definitely eyeing some of the upcoming colors. I love a lip color that takes care of itself! Looks hot AND, once it&#8217;s on, I don&#8217;t have to think about it! MAMA LIKE. I am going to plan lots of summer bbq outfits around this Pink Velvet/polka dot sunglasses combo. I am going to eat up all the potato salad and drink all the beer and my lipstick will still look beautiful.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Wait.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">If I&#8217;m going to eat all the potato salad and drink all the beer, I&#8217;m never going to find a swimsuit I like&#8230;</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">BETTER LUCK NEXT YEAR BATHING SUIT, YOU HATEFUL PIECE OF EXPENSIVE FABRIC.</p>
