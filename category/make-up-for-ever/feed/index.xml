<p style="text-align: center;"><em>1981 &#8211; These dirty birds brought me into the world.</em></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter  wp-image-478" alt="mom and dad 2005" src="/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/mom-and-dad-2005-1024x707.jpg" width="487" height="336" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/mom-and-dad-2005-1024x707.jpg 1024w, /wp-content/uploads/2013/07/mom-and-dad-2005-300x207.jpg 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2013/07/mom-and-dad-2005-1272x878.jpg 1272w, /wp-content/uploads/2013/07/mom-and-dad-2005.jpg 1600w" sizes="(max-width: 487px) 100vw, 487px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>2005 &#8211; I have more recent photos, but their dogs are hilarious.</em></p>
<p>My mom looks like Mexican Mary J. Blige, my dad looks like if Harold Ramis and William Shatner had a baby. There are a lot of great things about being biracial. Having a crazy skin tone that&#8217;s hard to match isn&#8217;t one of them.</p>
<p>They* say in a thousand years everyone will look like me. That by then, everybody will have humped each other into one race, and we&#8217;ll all be sort of brown. I think these are some science facts I heard. It seems right to me.</p>
<p>Those beautiful, caramel colored, future people are lucky because MAKE UP FOR EVER HD Foundation exists. They&#8217;ve already totally nailed our hard to match olive skin tone. Everyone is always trying to make me so pink! Or, so yellow! Or, so pale! I&#8217;m like, weirdly pale, but also brown. I often feel like I&#8217;m settling with the color of my foundations and powders. They&#8217;ll seem right at first, but soon I&#8217;ll feel like I&#8217;m looking really flushed, or like my jaw doesn&#8217;t match my neck. That&#8217;s really tough for someone who thinks about makeup as much as I do. Like, I have enough to worry about in photos. I don&#8217;t need this too!</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-475" alt="MAKE UP FOR EVER HD Foundation" src="/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/MAKE-UP-FOR-EVER-HD-Foundation.jpg" width="450" height="450" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/MAKE-UP-FOR-EVER-HD-Foundation.jpg 450w, /wp-content/uploads/2013/07/MAKE-UP-FOR-EVER-HD-Foundation-150x150.jpg 150w, /wp-content/uploads/2013/07/MAKE-UP-FOR-EVER-HD-Foundation-300x300.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 450px) 100vw, 450px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://www.sephora.com/hd-invisible-cover-foundation-P217905"><em>Sephora, $42</em></a></p>
<p>Until the time comes that there&#8217;s the need for only one foundation color, MAKE UP FOR EVER has 26 shades available, to cover a wide range of skin tones. This foundation has really great, buildable coverage that leaves a soft, flawless finish. I apply it, a couple pumps at a time, off the back of my hand, using my <a href="http://www.sigmabeauty.com/Sigma_Flat_Top_Synthetic_Kabuki_F_80_p/f80.htm">Sigma Beauty F80 Flat Kabuki brush</a>, from the center of my face, out. I love it because it blends beautifully, and evens out my skin without totally covering my moles and freckles. I don&#8217;t want a totally flat face, you know? It doesn&#8217;t settle into lines and creases, and it doesn&#8217;t get gross or cakey looking throughout the day. It also works on different skin types, and ages. I&#8217;m more dry/combination, but my mom is very oily and she uses it too. Her skin tone is also very hard to match, and she was able to find a foundation that worked for her out of their line. That&#8217;s really saying something. My mom has been looking for a good match for, like, her entire life.</p>
<p>You don&#8217;t have to wear a powder over this foundation, I often don&#8217;t. But, if you want to, you can just use a light dusting of translucent powder.</p>
<p>I wanted to show you guys a photo. But, since I&#8217;ve had bronchitis for 5 days, I look really terrible right now. Like, really, I don&#8217;t even remember when I last washed my hair. Soooo&#8230;.I went through my photos and found one that showed my face really close.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="aligncenter  wp-image-476" alt="hd foundation face" src="/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/hd-foundation-face-768x1024.jpg" width="487" height="650" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/hd-foundation-face-768x1024.jpg 768w, /wp-content/uploads/2013/07/hd-foundation-face-225x300.jpg 225w, /wp-content/uploads/2013/07/hd-foundation-face.jpg 960w" sizes="(max-width: 487px) 100vw, 487px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">I don&#8217;t look anything like that right now. And, it&#8217;s so embarrassing that I just have all these photos of my own posed face readily available. For whatever occasion! The judgmental way the dog looks at me when I&#8217;m in front of the lights, taking a thousand barely different pictures of myself, is enough to know that I should be ashamed.</p>
<p>But you know what I&#8217;m not ashamed of? How awesome my skin looks since I started using this foundation.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>*Scientists? Worried racists? I swear I read this somewhere.</p>
