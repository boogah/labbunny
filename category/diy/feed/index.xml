										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I&#8217;m always on the lookout for new projects to start and abandon. I can&#8217;t help it, I&#8217;m just really passionate about half knitted scarves! Unfinished crafts are my life&#8217;s work.</p>
<p>Every once in a while, I screw up, and one gets done. Like these DIY watercolor mugs I found from <a href="http://www.poppytalk.com/2014/07/diy-watercolor-mug.html">Poppytalk</a>.</p>

<p>Gorgeous, right?Â I had the idea to put that lovely splash of color on a white ceramic pot as a birthday gift for a green thumbed friend! In my mind, she opens the box, pulls out the pot, and gets a tear in her eye from my beautiful, and very expensive looking, gift that was made all the more special by the fact that I did it with my own little hands. It was a very, very good plan.</p>
<p>Would the owner of this one of a kind piece of functional artwork please raise her hand?</p>
<p>&#8230;</p>
<p>&#8230;</p>
<p>Ok. I never sent it.</p>
<p>I have a good reason though! It came out, umm, not so good. She would have cried a little tear, but not from being overwhelmed by beauty and friendship.</p>
<p>Sorry, Missy.</p>
<p>Happy birthday?</p>
<p>This was extremely perplexing because my trial run came out pretty nice!</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1119" src="/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/watercolor-mug.jpg" alt="watercolor mug" width="640" height="640" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/watercolor-mug.jpg 640w, /wp-content/uploads/2015/01/watercolor-mug-150x150.jpg 150w, /wp-content/uploads/2015/01/watercolor-mug-300x300.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></p>
<p>Before I did the pot, I tried the process on a mug. It&#8217;s cool! I would have been happy if the pot had come out like this! I&#8217;m really sad it didn&#8217;t. I kind of feel like I know what I did wrong though, and I want to try it again. I&#8217;ve got nail polish <a title="Pretty Ladies All In a Row" href="/pretty-ladies-row/">out the yang</a>, and a lot of free time. Missy&#8217;s birthday might not be licked yet!</p>
<p>I bet you&#8217;re waiting to see the fucked up pot. Well, too bad. It&#8217;s too crusty looking, and it would bring great shame to our household. I&#8217;ll show it off when I get it right! Fingers crossed!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>That title is more like, On the Dumb. But, ACTUALLY, like On the Run.</p>
<p>On the Run? They should have called that show, &#8220;Get Your Fucking Life for Three Hours.&#8221; I&#8217;ve watched that HBO special two and a half times, and I haven&#8217;t stopped yelling at Bey to kill &#8217;em all dead. She&#8217;s doing it, too!! I mean, I have this need for a beanie with one of those Roman soldier brush thingies on top, now!</p>
<p><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/IMG_1326.jpg"><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter" src="/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/IMG_1326.jpg" alt="IMG_1326.JPG" width="498" height="744" /></a><br />
I&#8217;d stitch one up myself, but I&#8217;m a hundred percent sure the brush would just flop over like a melancholy rooster. And, also, I have no idea where you get one of those brushes.</p>
<p>On Saturday night, I had the champagne flowing, and the cheese plates stacked high. I don&#8217;t want to brag, but there were upwards of FIVE different kinds of cheeses. So, yeah. It was pretty fucking gross. I definitely got a stomach ache from all dat cheese. Worth it though!</p>
<p>In honor of the show, I broke out my <a href="http://emergingthoughts.com/Accessories/queen-beyonce-nail-decals.html">Sara M. Lyons &#8220;Queen Beyonce&#8221; nail decals</a>! I love these hilarious lil designs! They&#8217;re so perfect and cheeky! They&#8217;re also REALLY easy to apply; all you need are some small, sharp scissors, and a bowl of water. They&#8217;re basically temporary tattoos for your nails, they have the same application concept as that bitchin&#8217; ying-yang sign you bought out of the machine at the pizza parlor that one time.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="aligncenter" src="/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/IMG_1320.jpg" alt="IMG_1320.JPG" width="598" height="897" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Nails are one of my all time faves, Con Limon by Floss Gloss</em></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">I fucked mine up by not using a lighter polish underneath them. As a result, Bey looks a little jaundiced. Jayndiced? Haha. Get it?<br />
Bey-Z looks better here:</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="aligncenter" src="/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/IMG_1314.jpg" alt="IMG_1314.JPG" width="616" height="616" /><br />
<em>See? On the Thumb. Whomp, whomp.</em></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Sara (probs too familiar) makes dope shit that really speaks to me. Like, her <a href="https://www.etsy.com/listing/121781082/babewolf-sticker?">Babewolf</a>, or, her <a href="http://saramlyons.tumblr.com/post/29136201971/in-lux-we-trust-an-oldie-but-goodie">&#8220;In Lux We Trust&#8221; piece</a>, which is so awesome, it kind of makes me want to cry. I just realized I&#8217;m gushing, and I was gonna be all, &#8220;I&#8217;m a gusher,&#8221; but that&#8217;s not right. Let&#8217;s say, &#8220;I&#8217;m a fan.&#8221; That doesn&#8217;t sound as damp.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><a href="http://emergingthoughts.com/queen-beyonce-nail-decals.html">These Bey decals are available only from Emerging Thought. Buy them HERE.</a></p>
