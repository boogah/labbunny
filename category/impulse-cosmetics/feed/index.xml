<p style="text-align: center;"><em>I look incredible. </em></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">This lipstick has been kicking around my desk since before Christmas. I loved it right away, but it took me a minute to figure out what I was doing. This is my third attempt at a look for this color, and I finally did something I can show off! My first attempt got a lot of &#8220;corpse&#8221; centered feedback, so that was no good. For my second stab at it, I tried really hard to warm up my complexion, and I, um, overdid it. So that was no good either. But this&#8230;this makes me happy. I don&#8217;t look dead, and I don&#8217;t look like Tan Mom. If that&#8217;s not a success, I don&#8217;t know what is! Also, I did a hairdo. I am terrible at hairdos. Maybe it&#8217;s my lack of upper body strength, or my lack of patience, or maybe hairdos are just my beauty blind spot. I don&#8217;t know. But, look! I did one! So, yeah, I&#8217;d say things are going pretty great. I&#8217;m going to kick 2013 right in the butthole!</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">I bought this lipstick from <a href="http://www.etsy.com/shop/ImpulseCo">Impulse Cosmetics on Etsy</a>. Etsy can be hit or miss, I know this, but it worked out for me this time! The lipstick is moisturizing, and extremely pigmented with a mostly matte finish. It goes on fully opaque right away and wears great! I loved it. I really, really did. My one and only complaint was with the packaging. It comes in a lip balm like tube, which is fine, but I really struggle with a flat application area on lipstick. Without an angled tip or a brush, I always end up making my top lip all weird. Then I try to even it out, then I have to even that out, and so it goes on until my lips are a mess.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter  wp-image-891" alt="impulse cosmetics smoking gun" src="/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/impulse-cosmetics-smoking-gun.jpg" width="587" height="440" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/impulse-cosmetics-smoking-gun.jpg 1632w, /wp-content/uploads/2014/01/impulse-cosmetics-smoking-gun-300x225.jpg 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2014/01/impulse-cosmetics-smoking-gun-1024x768.jpg 1024w, /wp-content/uploads/2014/01/impulse-cosmetics-smoking-gun-1272x954.jpg 1272w" sizes="(max-width: 587px) 100vw, 587px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">So, that&#8217;s not ideal, but it&#8217;s totally workable. No big deal! I&#8217;ll tell you what IS a BIG DEAL: THE PRICE. These lipsticks are only $6.99! Get it?! A BIG DEAL! My jokes have lots of layers, you guys. Jokes on jokes on jokes.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">This particular color, Smoking Gun, isn&#8217;t available. But, <a href="http://www.etsy.com/shop/ImpulseCo?section_id=12473049&amp;ref=shopsection_leftnav_4">the colors that are up right now</a> are FABULOUS. There are about six colors on that page that are beckoning to me. &#8220;Sarah&#8230;..you don&#8217;t have a color like me! Buy me! Buy me! BUY ALL OF US!!&#8221; And I&#8217;m like, &#8220;You&#8217;re the lipstick!&#8221; Then, I add them all to my cart.</p>
