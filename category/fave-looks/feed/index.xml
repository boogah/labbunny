<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Dat liner doe.</em></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">I&#8217;m a sucker for a purple lip.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Purple eyeshadow, too. I&#8217;m a sucker for purple eyeshadow.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">PURPLE NAILS! Don&#8217;t even get me started!!</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Long story short; I guess purple is my favorite color.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Well&#8230;and black. Is leopard a color? No, that&#8217;s silly! Leopard is a neutral!</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">&#8220;Leopard is a neutral,&#8221; has been my life motto since I was 16. I figured it out, and never looked back.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">WE&#8217;RE NOT PREACHING THE JOYS OF LEOPARD, SARAH. REMEMBER YOUR FIVE Gs.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1082" src="/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/latrice-gif.gif" alt="latrice gif" width="500" height="280" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><span style="text-align: left;">GOOD GOD, GET A GRIP, GIRL. </span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">The look above mixes up a purple lip with a leopard top, so I was pretty into it.  The lip is MAC&#8217;s Heroine, a vibrant, red-based purple. This color was a cult hit that MAC brought back, and made a part of their permanent collection. That&#8217;s good news because I could really see myself finishing this tube of lipstick. I mean, as soon as it came home, I made it a part of MY permanent collection (the zipper pouch inside my purse).</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Heroine has a satin finish, and it wears down to a bright matte that has a lot of staying power. I really appreciate that in a lip color. I love to do my makeup, but, I really hate having to constantly reapply my lip. I&#8217;m a modern woman! I don&#8217;t have time for that kind of nonsense. I don&#8217;t have time, and, also, I forget. And, also, pizza.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Oh, man. Pizza sounds so good right now. What time is it? 9:15?!?! Pizza isn&#8217;t even open yet. That&#8217;s ok. Everyone knows the sweetest pizza is the one you have to wait for.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">This lip color goes with all my favorite faces; neutral eye/bold lip, bold eye/bold lip, glasses/bold lip.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter  wp-image-1081" src="/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/MAC-Heroine-x-glasses.jpg" alt="MAC Heroine x glasses" width="516" height="516" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/MAC-Heroine-x-glasses.jpg 960w, /wp-content/uploads/2014/09/MAC-Heroine-x-glasses-150x150.jpg 150w, /wp-content/uploads/2014/09/MAC-Heroine-x-glasses-300x300.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 516px) 100vw, 516px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Glasses/bold lip goes ANYWHERE, with EVERYTHING. I love it! If you wear glasses, and you want some compliments, do it. People fucking love it. If you don&#8217;t have glasses, I feel bad for you, you&#8217;re obviously a dum-dum. Everyone knows glasses make you super smart. Glasses are also the best way to hide your true beauty. When you take them off, everyone is super impressed by how good looking and popular you are! WOWZA.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">This post, you guys, it&#8217;s not so good. I&#8217;m sorry. I accidentally took a summer vacation, now I&#8217;m super rusty!</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="aligncenter  wp-image-1083" src="/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/Rusty.png" alt="Rusty" width="471" height="312" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/Rusty.png 400w, /wp-content/uploads/2014/09/Rusty-300x198.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 471px) 100vw, 471px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>ACTUAL SUPER RUSTY</em></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">That Rusty might be my favorite. I love the Anthony Michael Hall Rusty, but, this Rusty is hysterical to me. Those Rustys are tied for first? Second place is Nick Papagiorgio Rusty. David from Roseanne Rusty is neither here nor there for me.</p>

The collection is small, only five pieces; an eyeshadow palette, red lipstick, liner and nail polish, and a glitter liner. Everything looks great, wearable and coordinated, but, I just couldn&#8217;t pull the trigger on the shadow palette. I think between all the Naked palettes, including the Basics palette, I&#8217;m pretty covered as far as neutral shadows are concerned. As much as I&#8217;d like to add this palette to my pile, I think I have to pass.</p>
<p>You have to understand how much this hurt me. Two of my favorites things, UD shadow palettes and Pulp Fiction, are colliding! In faaaaaact, I&#8217;d say both UD and Pulp Fiction came into my life around the same time, 20 years ago. I can remember both the first time I bought a UD product, and the first time I watched Pulp Fiction. Combine that with the fact that the whole collection is based on one of my all time BANGS ICONS, Mia Wallace, and you get me in that makeup frenzy where I can&#8217;t think straight.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-1053" src="/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/mia-dance-gif.gif" alt="mia dance gif" width="490" height="340" /></p>
<p>I wore those bangs for 15 years, and I&#8217;ve been post-OD Mia Wallace for Halloween no less than three times. It&#8217;s not a stretch to call me a fan.</p>
<p>(**BEAUTY TIP** If you wear that Mia Wallace costume, complete with bloody nose and chest syringe, to the grocery store, <i>people will let you go to the front of the line because you look disgusting. **</i>END BEAUTY TIP**)</p>
<p>Lucky for me(?), my own BAD MOTHERFUCKER was in bed with me while I was loading up my online cart, and he reminded me that I had already decided to skip the shadows. He was right. I did decide that. I&#8217;m glad he&#8217;s around to keep me from accidentally snorting from the wrong baggie, or, buying eyeshadows I don&#8217;t need.</p>
<p>Not that I skipped the whole collection. I didn&#8217;t. I have the blood red &#8220;Mia Wallace&#8221; lip liner and lipstick coming to me, and you guys will see it soon! I wish I could afford to buy everything, just because I want it, but there are no super valuable briefcases around here. I am, however, available to take any and all falls for the right price. The falls don&#8217;t even have to be in boxing!</p>
<p>I am not available for watch storage.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Thanks to the freak nasty dude I live with for coming up with, &#8220;Saturday Night Beaver.&#8221;</em></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">I&#8217;m a little obsessed with the glam and disco era of the 70s. I like glitter and dancing! I like freewheeling lifestyles! I like John Travolta! I don&#8217;t know, guys, I think I would have been really popular at Studio 54. I&#8217;m a good time!</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">I want to start doing photo steps of these look breakdowns, but this one is super easy, so I&#8217;m just going to run through it.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">The eyes are all Urban Decay. First, I used &#8220;Gonzo&#8221; from the Electric Palette around the eye, all over the lid, and dragged it out towards my hairline. Then, on the inner corners, I used UD&#8217;s Heavy Metal Glitter Eyeliner in &#8220;Midnight Cowboy.&#8221; I also lightly patted some of the glitter on my temples, over the smudged out teal shadow. A matte nude shadow on the brow bone, and some mascara finishes the eye.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Lips were a fun combination of orange and gold. I used &#8220;Indie Flick,&#8221; a matte orange, by NYX Cosmetics. After that, I pressed a little bit of gold shadow into the center of my lips. I used &#8220;Half Baked&#8221; by Urban Decay.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">I had so much fun with this look! I didn&#8217;t use it for anything, but Jason and Rowdy were really impressed! I mean, really, this was the hair day of my life. I wish it could look like this every day! My braiding skills still suck though, so I&#8217;ll just have to wait until the next time I can convince a friend to get her hands all up in my scalp.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">I sent pictures of this look to my mom for an accuracy check, and she gave it her seal of approval. Let me tell you, she knows what she&#8217;s talking about, I&#8217;ve seen her do The Hustle.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">What do you guys think? I love it! Any questions?</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><em><a href="http://www.urbandecay.com/what%27s-new/electric-pressed-pigment-palette/421.html">Electric Pressed Pigment Palette, Urban Decay, $49</a></em></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">I ordered this bad mamajama last Monday morning, when Urban Decay released it. It was in my mailbox on Friday, and I have looked <em><strong>exquisite</strong></em> every day since then. I haven&#8217;t really had anywhere to go, BUT, I&#8217;ve been looking foine while I&#8217;m cleaning toilets and wrapping dog pills in American cheese. Today, I&#8217;m going to wear a full face while I clean our room. Is that a fitting activity for the way I look today? No, but it looks like a dirty panty bomb went off in there, and I can&#8217;t keep living this way. Maybe this is other people&#8217;s idea of good room decor *coughJasoncough* but it ain&#8217;t mine. Also, I&#8217;m out of underwear.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">MOVING ON.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Back in the early years, crazy colors were what first drew me to Urban Decay. I was snapping up nearly every palette they released! The first few little ones, all the Book of Shadows palettes, Alice in Wonderland, the Anniversary Palette, Vice, more little ones! And that&#8217;s not even counting the single shadows I picked up. Then, around the time I started to feel like I had to tone it down a little, so did UD. So, then I bought all four of the Naked palettes! The Smoked palette! The Black Palette! I don&#8217;t think I need to tell you I don&#8217;t really have a lot of counter or drawer space. There are so many palettes, they have a dedicated cubby. Once the Naked palettes came around, I started doing my makeup way more neutral, and I had found myself wondering if I was ever going to go back to wearing a bright colored shadow. Honestly, as much as I used to love it, I didn&#8217;t know if it was me anymore.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Cue Urban Decay reading my mind again!</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="aligncenter  wp-image-967" alt="electic palette inside" src="/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/electic-palette-inside-1272x954.jpg" width="564" height="423" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/electic-palette-inside-1272x954.jpg 1272w, /wp-content/uploads/2014/03/electic-palette-inside-300x225.jpg 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2014/03/electic-palette-inside-1024x768.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 564px) 100vw, 564px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Top Row, L-R: Revolt, Gonzo, Slowburn, Savage, Fringe</em><br />
<em>Bottom Row, L-R: Chaos, Jilted, Urban, Freak, Thrash</em></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="aligncenter  wp-image-973" alt="electric palette swatches" src="/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/electric-palette-swatches-1272x1052.jpg" width="545" height="451" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/electric-palette-swatches-1272x1052.jpg 1272w, /wp-content/uploads/2014/03/electric-palette-swatches-300x248.jpg 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2014/03/electric-palette-swatches-1024x847.jpg 1024w, /wp-content/uploads/2014/03/electric-palette-swatches.jpg 1912w" sizes="(max-width: 545px) 100vw, 545px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">GAH. Those are bright! When I first saw them, I was like, &#8220;I don&#8217;t know&#8230;.&#8221; Then, I bought them, and I was like, &#8220;OH. WAIT. I DO KNOW. I LOVE THEM.&#8221; I haven&#8217;t been able to keep my hands out of it. I even set up my makeup station at the kitchen table, and I look at the palette while I eat my Eggos. Syrup is part of my creative process, ok?</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">The powders are so silky and rich, they&#8217;re really beautiful. I&#8217;m talking HUGE color payoff, plus, they blend like buttah. I never stood a chance. UD enticed me back to bold colors, and I am happy about it! I used my matte UD eye primer for all of these looks except the last one when it occurred to me to try my white eyeshadow base. Also, I did my eyes before I did my foundation or anything else on my face. I didn&#8217;t actually get a lot of fall out from these shadows, but what does fall is so intense, you&#8217;ll want to be able to just sweep it away with a brush. I haven&#8217;t yet had the chance to use every color in the palette, but I plan on continuing to play with it, and I&#8217;ll post any other looks I do. For now, I have three looks to show you!</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="aligncenter  wp-image-968" alt="electric palette look 1" src="/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/electric-palette-look-1.jpg" width="587" height="587" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/electric-palette-look-1.jpg 1632w, /wp-content/uploads/2014/03/electric-palette-look-1-150x150.jpg 150w, /wp-content/uploads/2014/03/electric-palette-look-1-300x300.jpg 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2014/03/electric-palette-look-1-1024x1024.jpg 1024w, /wp-content/uploads/2014/03/electric-palette-look-1-1272x1272.jpg 1272w" sizes="(max-width: 587px) 100vw, 587px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">I&#8217;m a sucker for cobalt blue; it&#8217;s one of my all time favorite cosmetics or accent colors. I had to try it first! It was flirting with me! Like, practically waggling its tongue at me, and we all know how ladies can&#8217;t resist that! This look was done using just Chaos on the lid, Revolt in the inner corners, and a matte nude from the Naked Basics palette to clean above the crease and up to the brow bone. I used a liquid liner on my top lid, and one of my black UD pencil liners on the bottom, the blush is actually the hot pink color, Savage, from the same palette, and I finished it off with UD&#8217;s Revolution lipstick in Naked. I&#8217;m sorry, but I looked really beautiful that day.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="aligncenter  wp-image-969" alt="electric palette look 2" src="/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/electric-palette-look-2.jpg" width="587" height="587" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/electric-palette-look-2.jpg 1632w, /wp-content/uploads/2014/03/electric-palette-look-2-150x150.jpg 150w, /wp-content/uploads/2014/03/electric-palette-look-2-300x300.jpg 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2014/03/electric-palette-look-2-1024x1024.jpg 1024w, /wp-content/uploads/2014/03/electric-palette-look-2-1272x1272.jpg 1272w" sizes="(max-width: 587px) 100vw, 587px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Look Two was the easiest one to work up. I wet my brush with saline solution, and used Fringe as a liner on my top lid, with Freak lining the bottom lash line. I also dabbed Revolt into the corners of my eyes, and used Savage as blush again. Lips are UD&#8217;s Super-Saturated High Gloss Lip Color pencil in Crush. For some dumb reason, I forgot to take a picture of this one with my eyes closed. It&#8217;s too late now! We&#8217;re all just going to have to get on with our lives. I&#8217;m not sure how I feel about my mismatched earrings, is it like Janet Jackson, or, is it like a pirate? Is it like pirate Janet Jackson? Is there still such a thing as &#8220;the gay ear&#8221;? Do I look crazy? I think I like it, but I&#8217;m halfway through a bottle of wine right now.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="aligncenter  wp-image-970" alt="electric palette look 3" src="/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/electric-palette-look-3.png" width="587" height="587" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/electric-palette-look-3.png 1632w, /wp-content/uploads/2014/03/electric-palette-look-3-150x150.png 150w, /wp-content/uploads/2014/03/electric-palette-look-3-300x300.png 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2014/03/electric-palette-look-3-1024x1024.png 1024w, /wp-content/uploads/2014/03/electric-palette-look-3-1272x1272.png 1272w" sizes="(max-width: 587px) 100vw, 587px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>GAZE UPON ME, IT&#8217;S ALLOWED. NO EYE CONTACT PLEASE.</em></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">I thought that first look was my favorite, and then I did this one. Are you freaking kidding me with this? UD&#8217;s purples have always been my favorites. It&#8217;s their signature color, they do it right, and Urban is no exception. For this look, I used the dark pink color, Jilted, in the crease, blended that forever, then added Urban to the lid, and blended THAT forever, too. I lined my top water line and lower lash line with the same black UD pencil, then, I smudged Urban underneath that. Once again, I used Revolt in the corners, and Savage on the cheeks. The lip color is a drugstore nude.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Also&#8230;.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="aligncenter  wp-image-971" alt="electric palette look 4" src="/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/electric-palette-look-4.jpg" width="587" height="587" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/electric-palette-look-4.jpg 1632w, /wp-content/uploads/2014/03/electric-palette-look-4-150x150.jpg 150w, /wp-content/uploads/2014/03/electric-palette-look-4-300x300.jpg 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2014/03/electric-palette-look-4-1024x1024.jpg 1024w, /wp-content/uploads/2014/03/electric-palette-look-4-1272x1272.jpg 1272w" sizes="(max-width: 587px) 100vw, 587px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">I couldn&#8217;t resist trying it with my all time favorite UD lip color. Jilted!!!! The addition of this lip color changed the whole look into something way bolder. Which is, like, amazing for a look that already boasts bright purple and dark pink eye makeup.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="aligncenter  wp-image-972" alt="electric palette love" src="/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/electric-palette-love.jpg" width="576" height="768" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/electric-palette-love.jpg 960w, /wp-content/uploads/2014/03/electric-palette-love-225x300.jpg 225w, /wp-content/uploads/2014/03/electric-palette-love-768x1024.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 576px) 100vw, 576px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>4 EVA</em></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Do you see how we&#8217;re totally falling in love?</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">It&#8217;s my responsibility to inform you that some of these colors aren&#8217;t &#8220;approved&#8221; for use around the immediate eye area in the USA. From what I understand, they&#8217;re cleared in Europe, and that&#8217;s good enough for me. Just be aware if you have extremely sensitive eyes, I guess.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">So far, I have zero complaints about this palette. I&#8217;m so happy I bought it! I am looking dope and feeling good. The potency of this palette is so great that I bet nobody even noticed I need to get my eyebrows done. In fact, I bet nobody even noticed I wasn&#8217;t wearing pants in almost every picture. I am a master of mind control, and this palette has made me more powerful than ever!!!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: center;"> <img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="aligncenter  wp-image-938" alt="color tattoo looks diptic" src="/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/color-tattoo-looks-diptic.jpg" width="704" height="704" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/color-tattoo-looks-diptic.jpg 1632w, /wp-content/uploads/2014/02/color-tattoo-looks-diptic-150x150.jpg 150w, /wp-content/uploads/2014/02/color-tattoo-looks-diptic-300x300.jpg 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2014/02/color-tattoo-looks-diptic-1024x1024.jpg 1024w, /wp-content/uploads/2014/02/color-tattoo-looks-diptic-1272x1272.jpg 1272w" sizes="(max-width: 704px) 100vw, 704px" /></p>
<p>I&#8217;ve been working on this post for days! I&#8217;ve just been really distracted with, like, the Olympics, and learning to play ping pong, and I&#8217;ve had on pants and a bra SO MUCH this week, which is really, very unusual. Being seen in public a lot = less time sitting in front of my laptop. Also, I think I was telling myself this post might suck and second guessing myself tons, so I was making everything more difficult. That&#8217;s just maybe laziness disguised as self esteem problems, though. I don&#8217;t know! I guess you guys will be the judge. If it sucks, I was right, and if it doesn&#8217;t suck, I&#8217;m maybe lazy, or I maybe have self esteem problems, or, maybe both. Let&#8217;s find out!</p>
<p>Last week, I finally got around to grabbing a few of those Maybelline Color Tattoo cream shadows, and now I am OBSESSED. I hate that I&#8217;ve been not buying them all this time! They&#8217;re so easy to work with, and the color is long lasting. I&#8217;ve used them almost every day since I got them, and I have fully planned to buy several more.</p>
<p>Today, I want to show you two looks I&#8217;ve done, using the same colors. Since the colors and placement are the same, the looks are similar, but they&#8217;re both so pretty and wearable, I had to show you guys both.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="aligncenter  wp-image-937" alt="Color Tattoo Looks products" src="/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/Color-Tattoo-Looks-products-e1392915925502.jpg" width="783" height="587" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/Color-Tattoo-Looks-products-e1392915925502.jpg 1632w, /wp-content/uploads/2014/02/Color-Tattoo-Looks-products-e1392915925502-300x225.jpg 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2014/02/Color-Tattoo-Looks-products-e1392915925502-1024x768.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 783px) 100vw, 783px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">These are the colors I used for these looks. We&#8217;ve got <strong>W.O.S.</strong> from Urban Decay&#8217;s Naked Basics palette, Maybelline Color Tattoo cream shadows in <strong>Barely Branded</strong> and <strong>Tough as Taupe</strong>, and a Coastal Scents shadow in <strong>Wild Raisin</strong>.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="aligncenter  wp-image-945" alt="color tattoo looks swatches" src="/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/color-tattoo-looks-swatches.jpg" width="768" height="476" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/color-tattoo-looks-swatches.jpg 1280w, /wp-content/uploads/2014/02/color-tattoo-looks-swatches-300x186.jpg 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2014/02/color-tattoo-looks-swatches-1024x635.jpg 1024w, /wp-content/uploads/2014/02/color-tattoo-looks-swatches-1272x789.jpg 1272w" sizes="(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>L-R: Costa Riche liner, W.O.S, Tough as Taupe, Barely Branded, Wild Raisin</em></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Before I begin, I always use my Urban Decay Primer Potion. Then, on the first look only, I used W.O.S. on the entire lid; just to even out the skin, and to give the cream shadow something else behind it. Now for the fun part!</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="aligncenter  wp-image-939" alt="color tattoo look steps" src="/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/color-tattoo-look-steps.jpg" width="538" height="538" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/color-tattoo-look-steps.jpg 1280w, /wp-content/uploads/2014/02/color-tattoo-look-steps-150x150.jpg 150w, /wp-content/uploads/2014/02/color-tattoo-look-steps-300x300.jpg 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2014/02/color-tattoo-look-steps-1024x1024.jpg 1024w, /wp-content/uploads/2014/02/color-tattoo-look-steps-1272x1272.jpg 1272w" sizes="(max-width: 538px) 100vw, 538px" /></p>
<ol>
<li>Using a flatter brush, I applied Tough as Taupe over the lid, just to the crease.</li>
<li>Line the upper lash line and water line with a dark brown or grey liner; I used MAC&#8217;s Costa Riche. Smudge the line.</li>
<li>Using the pads of your fingers, gently pat Barely Branded around the edges of Tough as Taupe, blending upwards and onto the brow bone.</li>
<li>Apply Wild Raisin to the crease and the outer corner of the eye, then BLEND THE HELL OUT OF IT.</li>
</ol>
<p>And that&#8217;s it! If you want, you can lightly line your bottom lash line with the liner or the remaining product on the flat brush from the first step. Add some mascara, and you&#8217;re done!</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="aligncenter  wp-image-940" alt="color tattoo look 1" src="/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/color-tattoo-look-1.jpg" width="518" height="691" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/color-tattoo-look-1.jpg 960w, /wp-content/uploads/2014/02/color-tattoo-look-1-225x300.jpg 225w, /wp-content/uploads/2014/02/color-tattoo-look-1-768x1024.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 518px) 100vw, 518px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Lips: UD&#8217;s Naked</em></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Look Two is exactly the same as Look One, except you switch Wild Raisin and Tough as Taupe. So, Wild Raisin will cover your lid, and Tough as Taupe will get blended into the crease. It looks like this:</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="aligncenter  wp-image-941" alt="color tattoo look 2 detail" src="/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/color-tattoo-look-2-detail.jpg" width="518" height="691" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/color-tattoo-look-2-detail.jpg 960w, /wp-content/uploads/2014/02/color-tattoo-look-2-detail-225x300.jpg 225w, /wp-content/uploads/2014/02/color-tattoo-look-2-detail-768x1024.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 518px) 100vw, 518px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Lips: UD&#8217;s Protest</em></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="aligncenter  wp-image-943" alt="color tattoo look 2 close" src="/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/color-tattoo-look-2-close1.jpg" width="518" height="691" /></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">I&#8217;ve worn my makeup one of these two ways almost every day since last Friday. I just love how easy and flattering it is! And how awesome is it that these shadows are super cheap? I guess the Naked palette isn&#8217;t super cheap, but that color is also sort of unnecessary to the look, so who cares?! I&#8217;ve been doing this blog for almost a year, and the one thing I&#8217;ve learned is that my makeup snobbery has been keeping me from a lot of good makeup. Maybelline, in particular, has become a new favorite of mine. I never ever thought I&#8217;d be searching everywhere for a particular drugstore product like I do with high end brands, but here I am. It&#8217;s cool though, you know. Cheap products means more products, and Maybelline is always on sale, AND you can use your Ulta coupons on their stuff. I&#8217;m rolling in affordable cream shadows over here!</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">What do you guys think? Do you have any questions?</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Buy Maybelline Color Tattoo shadows basically everywhere.<br />

<p style="text-align: center;"><em>I look incredible. </em></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">This lipstick has been kicking around my desk since before Christmas. I loved it right away, but it took me a minute to figure out what I was doing. This is my third attempt at a look for this color, and I finally did something I can show off! My first attempt got a lot of &#8220;corpse&#8221; centered feedback, so that was no good. For my second stab at it, I tried really hard to warm up my complexion, and I, um, overdid it. So that was no good either. But this&#8230;this makes me happy. I don&#8217;t look dead, and I don&#8217;t look like Tan Mom. If that&#8217;s not a success, I don&#8217;t know what is! Also, I did a hairdo. I am terrible at hairdos. Maybe it&#8217;s my lack of upper body strength, or my lack of patience, or maybe hairdos are just my beauty blind spot. I don&#8217;t know. But, look! I did one! So, yeah, I&#8217;d say things are going pretty great. I&#8217;m going to kick 2013 right in the butthole!</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">I bought this lipstick from <a href="http://www.etsy.com/shop/ImpulseCo">Impulse Cosmetics on Etsy</a>. Etsy can be hit or miss, I know this, but it worked out for me this time! The lipstick is moisturizing, and extremely pigmented with a mostly matte finish. It goes on fully opaque right away and wears great! I loved it. I really, really did. My one and only complaint was with the packaging. It comes in a lip balm like tube, which is fine, but I really struggle with a flat application area on lipstick. Without an angled tip or a brush, I always end up making my top lip all weird. Then I try to even it out, then I have to even that out, and so it goes on until my lips are a mess.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="aligncenter  wp-image-891" alt="impulse cosmetics smoking gun" src="/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/impulse-cosmetics-smoking-gun.jpg" width="587" height="440" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/impulse-cosmetics-smoking-gun.jpg 1632w, /wp-content/uploads/2014/01/impulse-cosmetics-smoking-gun-300x225.jpg 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2014/01/impulse-cosmetics-smoking-gun-1024x768.jpg 1024w, /wp-content/uploads/2014/01/impulse-cosmetics-smoking-gun-1272x954.jpg 1272w" sizes="(max-width: 587px) 100vw, 587px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">So, that&#8217;s not ideal, but it&#8217;s totally workable. No big deal! I&#8217;ll tell you what IS a BIG DEAL: THE PRICE. These lipsticks are only $6.99! Get it?! A BIG DEAL! My jokes have lots of layers, you guys. Jokes on jokes on jokes.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">This particular color, Smoking Gun, isn&#8217;t available. But, <a href="http://www.etsy.com/shop/ImpulseCo?section_id=12473049&amp;ref=shopsection_leftnav_4">the colors that are up right now</a> are FABULOUS. There are about six colors on that page that are beckoning to me. &#8220;Sarah&#8230;..you don&#8217;t have a color like me! Buy me! Buy me! BUY ALL OF US!!&#8221; And I&#8217;m like, &#8220;You&#8217;re the lipstick!&#8221; Then, I add them all to my cart.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Witch-ay Woman</em></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">A commenter asked about the other makeup I&#8217;m wearing in this photo from <a title="OCC Lip Tar All-Star Mini x 4 Set: Anime &amp; Black Dahlia" href="/occ-lip-tar-star-mini-x-4-set-anime-black-dahlia/">my review of the OCC Lip Tar All-Star Mini set</a>. I was like, duh, I should probably start including that information along with my photos. I guess I probably never thought about it because I am the worst and I like to keep all my secrets to myself. Like, if you gush about my sunglasses and ask where I got them, I&#8217;ll tell you&#8211;but, inside, I really don&#8217;t want to. I know. That&#8217;s terrible. And it&#8217;s not even the grossest thing about me. Don&#8217;t worry, I get karma back on it. A couple months ago, I asked a lady at the farmers market where she got her sunglasses, and she was all, &#8220;I don&#8217;t remember.&#8221; And I was like, &#8220;Girl. Yeah, right.&#8221; It&#8217;s like Justin Timberlake says, &#8220;What goes around, goes around, goes around, comes all the way back around.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">So, the makeup in this picture!</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Eyes &#8211; It looks like I used three shadows for this look. From the original Urban Decay Naked palette, I used &#8220;Virgin&#8221; for the brow bone and &#8220;Half Baked&#8221; for the inner eye corners. The bulk of the shadow, the wine color, is from a very old TIGI Cosmetics palette. I tried to find it, and unfortunately, it doesn&#8217;t look like they make it anymore. I swear this is not me just trying not to tell. I bough the palette when I was in beauty school a million years ago, and I probably shouldn&#8217;t even be using it anymore. The color was just called, &#8220;Wine,&#8221; and it&#8217;s not very hard to dupe; any wine color that leans more towards a plum will do the trick. I used a white pencil liner from the Sephora collection on my lower waterline, and UD&#8217;s black pencil liner on my bottom lash line and upper waterline. The mascara is Benefit&#8217;s They&#8217;re Real.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Eyebrows &#8211; Anastasia Beverly Hills Brow Powder Duo in &#8220;Brunette/Dark Brown&#8221; is my go to brow product. I use a light mixture of the two colors on a thin angled brush.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Blush &#8211; &#8220;Peaches&#8221; Sheertone Blush by MAC.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Lips &#8211; OCC Lip Tar in &#8220;Black Dahlia&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">There you have it! I guess I really don&#8217;t mind telling about makeup and beauty stuff. I mean, if I did, I probably wouldn&#8217;t have started a beauty blog. So, the good news is, my shadiness only extends to accessories! The bad news is, I will never ever start a sunglasses and bracelets blog.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://flossgloss.com/collections/lacquers/products/selena-corpus-crystalina"><em>Floss Gloss, $8</em></a></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Ever since Floss Gloss released their Selena tribute color, I&#8217;ve been yearning for it. I finally picked it up during their Black Friday sale, and even though it&#8217;s been a while since I&#8217;ve used any glitter on my nails, I am BEYOND excited to be wearing this polish. For reasons that are about to become clear, it&#8217;s been a really great morning for my hands.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Selena Corpus Crystalina is a sheer white glitter with a brilliant holographic sheen. In the bottle, it&#8217;s pretty, but on the nail, it really shines. I used three coats of polish to swatch the color by itself, and I wanted to keep adding layer after layer because with every new coat, it became sparklier.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="aligncenter  wp-image-826" alt="floss gloss selena swatch" src="/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/floss-gloss-selena-swatch-768x1024.jpg" width="487" height="650" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/floss-gloss-selena-swatch-768x1024.jpg 768w, /wp-content/uploads/2013/12/floss-gloss-selena-swatch-225x300.jpg 225w, /wp-content/uploads/2013/12/floss-gloss-selena-swatch-1272x1696.jpg 1272w" sizes="(max-width: 487px) 100vw, 487px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">I was having an impossible time trying to get this polish to do its thing in photographs. I wanted to show all the colors that glittered everywhere, but my camera was just not having it. I tried doing it in different light, and at different angles, but nothing I tried made it easier to capture the way this polish looks like rhinestones. I needed something behind it to set it off.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Then I had the most brilliant idea I&#8217;ve ever had!!!!!!! A brilliant idea to show off the color of this beautiful polish, while also showing my love for Selena.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Seriously. I thought of this, and I went crazy. I ran to my polish rack and my eyes instantly fell on the exact color I needed. The perfect color to show how this polish sparkles like crystals on, oh, I don&#8217;t know, let&#8217;s say&#8230;AN ICONIC PURPLE JUMPSUIT.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="aligncenter  wp-image-827" alt="floss gloss selena jumpsuit nails" src="/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/floss-gloss-selena-jumpsuit-nails-768x1024.jpg" width="487" height="650" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/floss-gloss-selena-jumpsuit-nails-768x1024.jpg 768w, /wp-content/uploads/2013/12/floss-gloss-selena-jumpsuit-nails-225x300.jpg 225w, /wp-content/uploads/2013/12/floss-gloss-selena-jumpsuit-nails-1272x1696.jpg 1272w" sizes="(max-width: 487px) 100vw, 487px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Selena Corpus Crystalina over <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Sally-Hansen-Complete-Manicure-Enamel/dp/B003VDEDZ6">Sally Hansen&#8217;s Plum Luck</a></em></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">BEST IDEA I&#8217;VE EVER HAD!!! I was doing this manicure, and I was dizzy the whole time. That&#8217;s how giddy I was over my idea!! Like, shaking with excitement! Selena has a really special place in my heart. It&#8217;s so tragic we were never able to see how far she could go. She was so talented, beautiful and charismatic&#8230;I&#8217;m choking up. I can hardly even watch the movie without bawling my eyes out the whole time. When Selena and Chris see each other for the first time, after his makeover, and they instantly fall in love, it&#8217;s more romantic to me than anything else I&#8217;ve ever seen!</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="aligncenter  wp-image-828" alt="floss gloss selena jumpsuit diptich" src="/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/floss-gloss-selena-jumpsuit-diptich-1024x1024.jpg" width="557" height="557" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/floss-gloss-selena-jumpsuit-diptich-1024x1024.jpg 1024w, /wp-content/uploads/2013/12/floss-gloss-selena-jumpsuit-diptich-150x150.jpg 150w, /wp-content/uploads/2013/12/floss-gloss-selena-jumpsuit-diptich-300x300.jpg 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2013/12/floss-gloss-selena-jumpsuit-diptich-1272x1272.jpg 1272w, /wp-content/uploads/2013/12/floss-gloss-selena-jumpsuit-diptich.jpg 1632w" sizes="(max-width: 557px) 100vw, 557px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">AUUUUUUGGGGHHHH!!!!!!!! PERFECT!!!!</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">I was planning on only doing one hand since I have other colors to swatch, but now that I see it, there&#8217;s no way I&#8217;m doing that. I am fully doing the other hand, at least for the weekend. The only reason I haven&#8217;t done it yet is because I wanted to rush in here and show you guys what I did.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">I love this polish. LOVE IT. It has enabled what might possibly be my greatest manicure of all time. Who knows when I&#8217;ll have another idea as good as this?</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">I did not set out to create amazing Selena tribute nails when I woke up this morning. Clearly, the angels have touched me today.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This was the eye look I did on Saturday night before we went out to a party.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-507" alt="SF smoky eye" src="/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/SF-smoky-eye-768x1024.jpg" width="696" height="928" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/SF-smoky-eye-768x1024.jpg 768w, /wp-content/uploads/2013/07/SF-smoky-eye-225x300.jpg 225w, /wp-content/uploads/2013/07/SF-smoky-eye.jpg 960w" sizes="(max-width: 696px) 100vw, 696px" /></p>
<p>With the exception of my Stila liquid liner, my mascara, and my white highlight liner, I used all Urban Decay products.</p>
<p>First, I applied UD&#8217;s <a href="http://www.urbandecay.com/highest-rated-and-most-loved/eyeshadow-primer-potion/296.html">Primer Potion in Eden</a> to my entire lid up to my eyebrows. Second, I used &#8220;KINKY&#8221; (matte nude) from UD&#8217;s <a href="http://www.urbandecay.com/urban-decay/eyes/smoked-eyeshadow-palette/333.html">Smoked Eyeshadow Palette</a> over my lid to the crease. Third, I used an angled brush to apply &#8220;GUNMETAL&#8221; (dark grey) from UD&#8217;s <a href="http://www.urbandecay.com/urban-decay/eyes/naked-palette/245.html">original Naked Palette</a> to the area a little above my crease and down to the outer corners, connecting in a &#8220;V&#8221; to my upper lash line. If you want to make your eyes look bigger, creating a false crease a little higher than your actual crease is a way to do it. Third, I used a fluffy brush to wash &#8220;TEASE&#8221; (taupe) from UD&#8217;s <a href="http://www.urbandecay.com/urban-decay/eyes/naked2-palette/282.html">Naked 2 Palette</a> over my entire lid, up to the dark grey crease, blending the edges as you go. Then, I picked up a little more of my matte nude color on my fluffy brush, and blended the outer edges of the grey crease. Last, I used &#8220;BOOTYCALL&#8221; (frosty white-beige) from the Naked 2 Palette to accentuate my brow bone, always blending.</p>
<p>I lined my upper lash line and water line with &#8220;WHISKEY&#8217; (dark brown) from UD&#8217;s <a href="http://www.urbandecay.com/what%27s-new/24%2F7-double-ended-glide-on-pencil/347.html">24/7 Double-Ended Glide-On Pencil</a>, then I lined below my bottom lashes to about 3/4 across, leaving the area near my tear ducts, unlined. I went over the top line and created a winged line with my black <a title="Stila Stay All Day Waterproof Liquid Eyeliner" href="/stila-stay-all-day-waterproof-liquid-eyeliner/">Stila liner</a>. Then, I used a white liner to line my bottom water line to also give the appearance of bigger eyes. I finished it off with my <a title="Benefit They’re Real Mascara" href="/benefit-theyre-real-mascara/">They&#8217;re Real mascara from Benefit</a> on my top lashes only.</p>
<p>Since this look uses dark colors, I did my eyes before I did my foundation. That way, you can clean up any fallout you have and sharpen up any edges you&#8217;d like to define with your foundation brush. I&#8217;m not wearing it in this picture, but I did a nude lip.</p>
<p>Add a bun and giant earrings, and you&#8217;ve got yourself a look!</p>
<p>Sorry the photo quality isn&#8217;t great. I wasn&#8217;t taking pictures to put up here, I was taking pictures to check the blending and symmetry. Remember in &#8220;Clueless&#8221; when Cher takes Polaroids of all her outfits because she doesn&#8217;t trust mirrors? It&#8217;s like that. Plus, I was showing off and sending pics to my sister. Shame on me! PSYCH! I&#8217;m not ashamed.</p>
