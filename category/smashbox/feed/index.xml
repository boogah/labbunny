										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Along with Fall (my birthday, Halloween, no more bathing suits), Christmas is one of my favorite times of the year. Christmas the day is whatever to me; I love giving and getting presents, but all that cooking and cleaning can get out of here. The month leading up to Christmas is awesome though! People are nicer to each other, there are lights, and songs, and ornaments, and hot cocoa, and cookies! CHRISTMAS MOVIES! I&#8217;ve already watched &#8220;Christmas Vacation,&#8221; and &#8220;Love Actually.&#8221; I&#8217;ll hit &#8220;Scrooged&#8221; and &#8220;White Christmas&#8221; sometime soon. I&#8217;m emotionally gearing up for &#8220;Miracle on 34th Street,&#8221; and I&#8217;m saving &#8220;It&#8217;s a Wonderful Life&#8221; to watch with my mom. We like to cry together over that one. Stupid George Bailey gets me every time.</p>
<p>So, looking forward to Christmas, and inspired by a conversation I had with a friend, I&#8217;d like to help out with your shopping. Is my gift guide late to the party? Of course it is! Late to the party is my middle name. I actually like to BE late to parties. I wait just long enough for people to start wondering if I&#8217;m coming, and then BOOM there I am, drink in hand, making all your dreams come true.</p>
<p>This guide is for the budding makeup artist in your life, or for anyone who wants to improve their skills and get a little education.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>&#8220;Making Faces&#8221; by Kevyn Aucoin</strong></span></p>

<p style="text-align: left;"><a title="Making Faces by Kevyn Aucoin" href="/making-faces-by-kevyn-aucoin/">I wrote about my adoration for this book a couple months ago.</a> I&#8217;ve had my copy for nearly 15 years, and I still break it out all the time. I learned a lot about makeup application from my mom, but where her knowledge ended, this book picked it up. It&#8217;s extremely comprehensive and easy to understand, with clear instructions and pictures. Kevyn doesn&#8217;t just show you how to do eyeshadow, he shows you how to build your entire face from your bone structure up. His two makeup books are the only two I own. Nothing else comes close. &#8220;Making Faces&#8221; is an excellent guide for anyone, beginner or more experienced.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Sonia Kashuk Limited Edition Lavish Luxe 10 piece Brush Set</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-833" alt="Brush set" src="/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/Brush-set.png" width="594" height="480" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/Brush-set.png 594w, /wp-content/uploads/2013/12/Brush-set-300x242.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 594px) 100vw, 594px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://www.target.com/p/sonia-kashuk-limited-edition-lavish-luxe-10-pc-brush-set/-/A-14637465#prodSlot=medium_1_16"><em>Target, $29.99</em></a></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">If you&#8217;re buying for a beginner, you probably want to get them brushes that are nice, but not too expensive. This Sonia Kashuk set fits the bill perfectly. Are they the most high quality, makeup artist level brushes in the world? No. But, they&#8217;re pretty nice. Every Sonia Kashuk brush I have has stood up to frequent use and cleanings without any problems. This set is a good place to start building a brush collection. It has everything a beginner should need, and some stuff they&#8217;ll probably have to figure out. That&#8217;s fun though! That&#8217;s learning! I bought a set of brushes in beauty school almost 10 years ago that had a weird shaped brush in it. I never could figure it out until just this year! Mystery solved! The new artist in your life will get a lot of use out of these brushes, and they&#8217;ll be glad to not have to use those weird sponge foam tipped applicator things. Do they even put those in makeup anymore? Am I showing my age? Wait. Does pantyhose still come in eggs? Does anybody wear pantyhose anymore?! The internet sure has changed everything!</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">It doesn&#8217;t look like this brush set is available online, but they have it in store. At Target&#8217;s site, you can search the stores close to you for specific products, so that makes things easy.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://www.ulta.com/ulta/browse/productDetail.jsp?productId=xlsImpprod5960730"><em>Ulta exclusive, $39.00</em></a></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><a title="Smashbox Wonder Vision Mega Palette" href="/smashbox-wonder-vision-mega-palette/">I JUST reviewed this palette last week</a>, and it&#8217;s on sale now! How fortuitous! Last week, I talked about how I thought this palette would be fantastic for beginners, anyone who wants to expand their options without spending a lot of money, and anyone who struggles with palettes in general. I stand by all of that! With 30 shadows, 3 blushes and 1 bronzer, it&#8217;s got almost everything you&#8217;d need to start learning. The colors are wide ranging and beautifully coordinated with different finishes and consistencies. The palette even comes with clear, plastic instructional cards you place over the shadows to learn how to apply different eyeshadow looks. It was a great deal at $49, it&#8217;s a KILLER deal at $39. Plus, right now, with any $30 Smashbox purchase at Ulta, you get deluxe sample sizes of their fab Classic Primer and Photo Op Eye Brightening Mascara. Even better!</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><a href="http://www.ulta.com/ulta/browse/productDetail.jsp?productId=xlsImpprod5960730">Buy the Smashbox Wondervision Mega Palette exclusively at Ulta <strong>HERE</strong>.</a></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Throw in a couple of lipsticks or lip glosses. NYX and E.L.F. both have cheap, but good lip products. And right now there are tonnnnns of lipstick and gloss sets that are crazy cheap. Add in some brush cleanser because it&#8217;s never too early to learn to keep your tools clean and well maintained! You can get everything I&#8217;ve shown here for $85. So you can get a couple lippies and a cleanser and still keep it under $100. This will all make for a good start, and a happy makeup lover!</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://www.ulta.com/ulta/browse/productDetail.jsp?productId=xlsImpprod5960730"><em>Ulta exclusive, $49</em></a></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">WHEW! This palette was a chore to swatch and photograph. It&#8217;s really hard to shoot a picture of a mirror without capturing your own reflection. Have you ever caught your own face in a reflective surface before you had to time to prepare yourself? Yuck, right? It&#8217;s like that, but instead of being a passing glance, it&#8217;s there on your camera roll so you can really look at how squishy your chin looks.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Photography problems aside, I&#8217;ve been having so much fun with this palette! It&#8217;s been sitting in front of my mirror since I brought it home, and I&#8217;ve used it almost every time I&#8217;ve done my makeup since then. It&#8217;s the first non-Naked palette I&#8217;ve bought in a long time, and with 30 shadows, 3 blushes, and a bronzer, I think it&#8217;s a good buy.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">This post is going to be long on photos, maybe short on words. We&#8217;ll see. I never set out to write most of the stuff I end up posting.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="aligncenter  wp-image-816" alt="smashbox wonder vision inside" src="/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/smashbox-wonder-vision-inside-1024x768.jpg" width="557" height="418" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/smashbox-wonder-vision-inside-1024x768.jpg 1024w, /wp-content/uploads/2013/12/smashbox-wonder-vision-inside-300x225.jpg 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2013/12/smashbox-wonder-vision-inside-1272x954.jpg 1272w" sizes="(max-width: 557px) 100vw, 557px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="aligncenter  wp-image-817" alt="smashbox wonder vision interior" src="/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/smashbox-wonder-vision-interior-768x1024.jpg" width="557" height="742" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/smashbox-wonder-vision-interior-768x1024.jpg 768w, /wp-content/uploads/2013/12/smashbox-wonder-vision-interior-225x300.jpg 225w, /wp-content/uploads/2013/12/smashbox-wonder-vision-interior-1272x1696.jpg 1272w" sizes="(max-width: 557px) 100vw, 557px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">This palette contains a wide array of colors and finishes, and they&#8217;re all coordinated to make putting together looks easier. I tried to swatch all the colors on my arm, but, they didn&#8217;t show up like I&#8217;d hoped. This is the first time I&#8217;ve swatched a whole palette! Bear with me!</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="aligncenter  wp-image-818" alt="smashbox wonder vision swatch 1" src="/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/smashbox-wonder-vision-swatch-1-1024x579.jpg" width="557" height="314" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/smashbox-wonder-vision-swatch-1-1024x579.jpg 1024w, /wp-content/uploads/2013/12/smashbox-wonder-vision-swatch-1-300x169.jpg 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2013/12/smashbox-wonder-vision-swatch-1-1272x720.jpg 1272w" sizes="(max-width: 557px) 100vw, 557px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="aligncenter  wp-image-819" alt="smashbox wonder vision 2" src="/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/smashbox-wonder-vision-2-1024x552.jpg" width="557" height="300" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/smashbox-wonder-vision-2-1024x552.jpg 1024w, /wp-content/uploads/2013/12/smashbox-wonder-vision-2-300x161.jpg 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2013/12/smashbox-wonder-vision-2-1272x686.jpg 1272w" sizes="(max-width: 557px) 100vw, 557px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="aligncenter  wp-image-820" alt="smashbox wonder vision 3" src="/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/smashbox-wonder-vision-3-1024x554.jpg" width="557" height="301" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/smashbox-wonder-vision-3-1024x554.jpg 1024w, /wp-content/uploads/2013/12/smashbox-wonder-vision-3-300x162.jpg 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2013/12/smashbox-wonder-vision-3-1272x688.jpg 1272w" sizes="(max-width: 557px) 100vw, 557px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Most of the colors were very easy to work with, the exception being some of the matte, light colored shadows. A couple of them took a few more swipes of the brush to get them to show up bright, but that&#8217;s ok. They were still manageable, and I didn&#8217;t go, &#8220;Eww. No.&#8221; Which I&#8217;ll totally do! It wasn&#8217;t even close to a deal breaker for me. I&#8217;ll take a buildable color over a garish mess any day. Those couple of semi-sheer shadows were nothing when you put them with the rest of the shadows in this palette. The satin, and shimmery shadows were absolutely gorgeous. They blended nicely and the color payoff was great. The silver, in particular, was soooo pretty.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">I know a lot of people are intimidated by palettes. I&#8217;ve heard from two people just in the last week that they don&#8217;t know where to start with palettes, they aren&#8217;t sure how to use them, so they just don&#8217;t buy them. I understand that. That makes me sad though because palettes can be a really great buy. They&#8217;re particularly great if you want to expand your makeup collection without spending a lot of money. This Smashbox palette has 30 shadows in it for $49. Their eyeshadow trios contain colors that are just a touch bigger than the shadows in this palette, and those are $28. I think this palette would be great for beginners, or anyone who gets overwhelmed by their choices because Smashbox has made this palette very easy to use. Besides the coordinated colors, it comes with four clear plastic cards that show you how to combine colors to achieve a more in depth look. They&#8217;re really cool because you just place them over the colors you want to wear, and you can see exactly which colors you should be using where.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="aligncenter  wp-image-821" alt="smashbox wonder vision card" src="/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/smashbox-wonder-vision-card-1024x799.jpg" width="557" height="434" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/smashbox-wonder-vision-card-1024x799.jpg 1024w, /wp-content/uploads/2013/12/smashbox-wonder-vision-card-300x234.jpg 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2013/12/smashbox-wonder-vision-card-1272x992.jpg 1272w" sizes="(max-width: 557px) 100vw, 557px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Isn&#8217;t that rad?! I used the cards myself a few times to check them out, and the directions were clear and easy to handle. It&#8217;s a good way to learn a little more about how to apply shadows. Once you get the hang of it using the cards, you&#8217;ll probably feel more confident on your own with other shadows!</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">These are a couple looks I&#8217;ve done with this palette since I&#8217;ve had it. I don&#8217;t always take pictures in front of my lights and backdrop every time I do my makeup, we&#8217;d never get out of the house if I did. But, I did grab a couple. The first one is primarily silver, and the second one uses the rust colored shadows show above.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-822" alt="smashbox wonder vision look1" src="/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/smashbox-wonder-vision-look1.jpg" width="540" height="202" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/smashbox-wonder-vision-look1.jpg 540w, /wp-content/uploads/2013/12/smashbox-wonder-vision-look1-300x112.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 540px) 100vw, 540px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="aligncenter  wp-image-823" alt="smashbox wonder vision look2" src="/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/smashbox-wonder-vision-look2.jpg" width="540" height="202" /></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Sorry about the lighting in the last photo. I didn&#8217;t intend to use this picture here, I was just looking at my own face. You know how in Clueless, when Cher is picking out outfits, she says she always takes polaroids because she doesn&#8217;t trust mirrors? It&#8217;s the same thing as that. I catch things that need to blended or touched up all the time like this. Plus, I like  any opportunity to look at a good picture of myself!</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">The blushes are nice, they&#8217;re also buildable, so that&#8217;s good. I think a lot of people prefer that in a blush. The bronzer is GREAT. It isn&#8217;t shimmery, so it&#8217;s good for contouring. I&#8217;ve been using it to bring up my cheekbones, and I love it. I predict I&#8217;ll hit the pan on the bronzer, actually.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">This palette is a good buy financially and artistically. It has colors that can take you to a lot of different places with a lot of different looks. It makes application easy to understand, and easy to do. It would be really good for traveling. Wait. Do other people travel like I do? Does this seem like a lot to bring with you? I don&#8217;t think it does. You could slip this in between a couple of shirts, no problem. Then, you&#8217;d have neutrals and bright colors for whatever you wanted to do! It&#8217;s so easy!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As I&#8217;ve gotten older, I&#8217;ve tried to become the kind of person who can just be cool about their birthday; or, one of those people who can at least pretend to be cool about their birthday. It won&#8217;t take. I can&#8217;t be an, &#8220;Oh. It was my birthday last week, I just didn&#8217;t say anything. I don&#8217;t like to make a big deal,&#8221; person. It&#8217;s just not in me. I&#8217;m sorry, everyone. We&#8217;re just going to have to keep eating cake.</p>
<p>Except this year, we&#8217;re having pie. Because crust.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Look, I used to make my birthday lists in August. My birthday is less than a month away (Oct. 5th, if you&#8217;re curious. LIBRA LADIES REPRESENT.), so I think this is appropriate. As appropriate as a 31 year old woman with a public birthday wish list can be anyways. And this isn&#8217;t even everything! This is the stuff I&#8217;m super obsessed with right now! PERSONAL GROWTH.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Floss Gloss Nail Lacquers in <a href="http://flossgloss.com/collections/lacquers/products/stun">STUN</a> &amp; <a href="http://flossgloss.com/collections/lacquers/products/dimepiece">DIMEPIECE</a></strong></p>

<p>Every time I buy polish from <a href="http://flossgloss.com/">Floss Gloss</a>, I hover over these two glitters. I can never make up my mind, so I just end up without either one of them. Isn&#8217;t that a sad story?</p>
<p>I want one of these sexy stickers too.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="wp-image-635 aligncenter" alt="fg skripper" src="/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/fg-skripper.jpg" width="448" height="614" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/fg-skripper.jpg 747w, /wp-content/uploads/2013/09/fg-skripper-218x300.jpg 218w" sizes="(max-width: 448px) 100vw, 448px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://flossgloss.com/collections/stickers/products/skripper-sticker"><strong>SKRIPPER STICKER</strong></a></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">This sticker would give my laptop a little bit of, how you say, je ne sais ass and titties. It&#8217;s subtle, but I think it will work.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><a href="http://www.sephora.com/the-master-class-palette-ii-P379817?skuId=1523430">Smashbox The Master Class Palette II</a></strong></p>

Another sad story! Lucky for all of us Smashbox released their Master Class Palette II! I want to put this into my makeup bag and never let it leave. It will travel everywhere with me! It&#8217;ll see the world! Won&#8217;t someone PLEASE give this poor palette a chance to make something of itself!?</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">&#8216;AY. How cool is this ring?! Too fucking cool, right? It would look pretty great on my hands, and it would let everyone know what&#8217;s up. Namely, that I&#8217;m way, way loco. I take pills for it, but science can only go so far. People think Jason is the one to look out for, because he&#8217;s 6&#8217;5, and his fists look like hams; but you really gotta watch out for me. While you&#8217;re all distracted by Jason way up there, I&#8217;ll come in under your eye line and CUT CHU, MANG. Nah. I&#8217;m just playin&#8217;. I won&#8217;t cut chu. UNLESS YOU ASK FOR IT.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Nah.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">YES!</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">I WANT THIS SO BAD! I would really like to be able to see more of my makeup. The majority of it is packed away into a giant train case in my closet. I can&#8217;t gaze upon them from there. Also, you guys wouldn&#8217;t believe the stuff thats&#8217;s just sitting in there, never getting used, because it&#8217;s out of sight and out of mind. If you really think about it, this is kind of an investment that actually saves us money! If my forgotten eyeshadows are out where I can see them, they&#8217;ll get used, and they won&#8217;t go to waste. See! I&#8217;ve got all the best moneymaking ideas. You gotta spend money to make money! That&#8217;s what I always say. Or is it that I always just say spend money? I can&#8217;t remember. Better spend some money just to be on the safe side.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://www.sephora.com/cream-lip-stain-P281411?skuId=1323138"><strong>SEPHORA COLLECTION Cream Lip Stain in 04 Endless Purple</strong></a></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-642" alt="sephora lip stain2" src="/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/sephora-lip-stain2.jpg" width="450" height="450" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/sephora-lip-stain2.jpg 450w, /wp-content/uploads/2013/09/sephora-lip-stain2-150x150.jpg 150w, /wp-content/uploads/2013/09/sephora-lip-stain2-300x300.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 450px) 100vw, 450px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">I&#8217;ve really liked all of the Sephora branded lip products that I&#8217;ve bought in the past. In fact, for my birthday last year, I wore one of their matte long wear lipsticks in a crazy hot fuchsia. Natch. It stayed on for a loooong time. Through a lot of drinks, and birthday kisses and dip. I&#8217;m into this gloss, I&#8217;m curious how it stacks up to the <a title="Birchbox August 2013 Review" href="/birchbox-august-2013-review/">stila stain that was in my Birchbox last month</a>.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-91" alt="*****" src="/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/horizontal_rule.png" width="400" height="97" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/horizontal_rule.png 400w, /wp-content/uploads/2013/05/horizontal_rule-300x72.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Well, there you have it, some of the things that will ease my transition into 32. The rest of the things that will help are drinks, friends, tacos, and pie. And drinks. And pie. And some of that potion from &#8220;Death Becomes Her&#8221; that keeps you young forever.</p>
