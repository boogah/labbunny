										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I&#8217;m not a resolutions person. Obviously. I mean, here I am, knocking the dust off this blog well into the second (technically third) week of January. A resolutions person would have been here that first Monday. To me, New Year&#8217;s resolutions are amateur hour. I&#8217;m making and breaking promises to myself 365, BAYBAY!!</p>
<p>My problem is, I always go too big. Lose weight, save money, find my life&#8217;s purpose, blah blah. That stuff is a lot of work! You know what&#8217;s probably way better for our mental well-being? Starting small. Make your bed every day! Kick your panties into the hamper instead of leaving them sunny-side up in the bathroom! Mop!<br />
No. Don&#8217;t mop. I&#8217;m sorry I said that. FUCK mopping.</p>
<p>How about, instead, you could resolve to have cleaner skin? You don&#8217;t even have to buy a new face wash, or an expensive cleansing brush. Are you all ready for my ONE WEIRD TRICK?</p>
<p>Here it is:</p>
<p>Wash your face longer. For 60 whole seconds. That&#8217;s it.</p>
<p>Real talk, you guys; I know what you&#8217;re doing. I see how quickly you wash your face. I SEE YOU. But, it&#8217;s ok! I used to do the same thing! In fact, I considered myself a pretty accomplished face washer. I washed my face every night and most mornings, I used my Clarisonic. I would even wash my face when I was three sheets to an ill wind! Some of the mascara might be left behind, but, I&#8217;d AT LEAST use a cleansing wipe. So, pretty good, right? Pretty good, but could be better. Like, maybe better if I didn&#8217;t rush through it in just a few seconds. You know, like how washing a fork with soap real fast is good, but making sure you get all the crud off is preferable?</p>
<p>Still not convinced? (Pretend you&#8217;re not convinced.) Will a little bit of Beauty School Confidential help? Consider this; a big reason for the effectiveness of a spa facial is the extensive time spent on cleansing. Most estheticians will cleanse your skin twice during a facial. When all is said and done, you&#8217;re going to get, probably, a combined five minutes of solid cleanser on skin action. It&#8217;s not an accident that your skin is so bright after that! I mean, the <em>default</em> time on my Clarisonic is 60 seconds, and that thing is using sonic vibrations, or whatever, AND bristles. If the Clarisonic needs 60 seconds to get your face clean with all that technology behind it, your sweet lil fingers need at least that long. It&#8217;s so easy though! A big part of this cleaner face resolution is the simplicity, because hopefully, you&#8217;re already washing your face. So, you don&#8217;t have to do a whole new thing, you just have to a regular thing differently.</p>
<p>&#8220;But, Sarah,&#8221; you might be thinking, &#8220;60 seconds is a long time to count! What if I get bored or lose my place? What if I count too fast or too slow? How am I supposed to keep track of the time when I&#8217;m in the shower in all my nudely glory?!&#8221; It&#8217;s easy! Zones, guys. It&#8217;s all about zones. Your forehead? ZONE. Nose down to your chin? ZONE. Those precious cheeks? ZONE(S). Three zones, 20 seconds each. That&#8217;s all you need to do to get cleaner skin. It&#8217;s free, it&#8217;s easy, it works!</p>
<p>Since I&#8217;ve been making an effort to wash my face more thoroughly, I&#8217;ve seen a visible improvement in my skin. I have a lot less tiny white heads around my eye/cheek area, and, I haven&#8217;t been getting random, underground, throbbing, volcanic breakouts on my jaw and chin. I even managed to avoid the inevitable eruptions I deal with whenever I get sick, and those are usually really gross, and really hard to kill.</p>
<p><img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-1101 size-full" src="/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/clean-skin-e1421386030944.jpg" alt="clean skin" width="540" height="540" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">HASHTAG NO FILTER</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">HASHTAG NO FOUNDATION, too. That&#8217;s right. No foundation. I have on a little concealer around my nose to cover some tissue related redness, and, I have on a little under eye brightener. But, that&#8217;s it. No foundation, no powder. No filter! Just my clean, moisturized skin. For comparison, here&#8217;s an unedited photo from the end of last summer.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-1102 size-full" src="/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/clean-face-comparison-e1421387573768.jpg" alt="clean face comparison" width="540" height="540" /></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">I think you can tell a difference. In the first picture my skin looks brighter, clearer, and smoother. I&#8217;m wearing a full face in this photo, and my skin still doesn&#8217;t look as good. See what I&#8217;m saying? I&#8217;m not making it up!</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">I don&#8217;t even use an expensive cleanser.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1104" src="/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/cetaphil-cleanser.jpg" alt="cetaphil cleanser" width="300" height="400" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/cetaphil-cleanser.jpg 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2015/01/cetaphil-cleanser-225x300.jpg 225w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></p>

<p style="text-align: left;">Bet you didn&#8217;t think it was going to be THAT cheap. A cheap cleanser and your free fingers. That&#8217;s all you need. It&#8217;s really so easy! Easier than losing weight, easier than kicking your underwear into the hamper, easier than pretty much most things, and you get nicer skin. Happy freaking New Year! So fresh and so clean in 2015!</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://www.sephora.com/pore-minimalist-mask-P386840?skuId=1622380"><em>Sephora, $7.50 for one sheet or $35 for a box of five</em></a></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">A couple weeks ago, I hit the Sephora with a fellow childless enabler, and we had a lot of fun! Fun is a nice way of putting it. Rampage is a more accurate way of putting it. Like, did you know they have a sample limit at Sephora? Me neither! They way they told us, it seemed more like a suggestion, so we just kept hammering the samples anyways. I feel like my mid-level Sephora card entitles me to whatever I want in there. My VIB card, and my remaining bitterness over them making it seem like I had a job, and then not hiring me eight years ago. Last year, I made it a goal to let go of old grudges and annoyances, but that Sephora snub still stings. Especially when I saw homeboy that looks like Bobby fucking Hill working in there.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">I like to just stay mad about not getting the job that one time so I don&#8217;t have to go back and try again. STAY MAD. That&#8217;s what I always say. That job is probably so hard; you have to deal with petty assholes like me all day. BUT, there is lipstick&#8230;.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">In my defense, it&#8217;s not like I just go in and demand all the samples and don&#8217;t buy anything. That&#8217;s not a rampage. A rampage involves damage inflicted on a personal level, too. If you&#8217;re not swiping your debit card in a near blackout state, sister, you ain&#8217;t rampaging.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Amidst the frenzy, in a fog of Tom Ford fragrances, I grabbed one of these single sheet Dr. Jart+ Pore Minimalist Masks. Having never used a sheet mask before, I wasn&#8217;t sure what to expect. Since it was a sebum sucking and pore cleansing mask, I thought I&#8217;d get something sticky, or clay like. Instead, I got a fairly heavy mask that was absolutely drenched in a thin serum. Really, at that point, I was kind of confused, but, hey, I&#8217;m not a doctor! Dr. Jart is the doctor.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="aligncenter  wp-image-1092" src="/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/dr-jart-mask-photo-768x1024.jpg" alt="dr jart mask photo" width="546" height="728" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>-1 point for not having a mouth zipper.</em></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">After smoothing the mask onto my face, I realized, unless I kicked back, I was going to have a drippy mess to clean. I did not want that, and I didn&#8217;t want to waste any of that precious serum, so I put my head on my little pillow, and just <em>CHILLED.</em> The serum was really cool and relaxing, without any of the burning you can get from mint extracts.<i> </i>When the time was up, I peeled off the mask, and I was really surprised by how much serum my skin had absorbed. The mask wasn&#8217;t wet and heavy anymore, it was damp and papery. The directions said not to rinse, to just massage the remaining serum into the skin, and I am so about that. I hate washing off masks! I get so much water everywhere, it really might make more sense for me to just get in the shower. Same amount of toweling off, less water on the floor.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">I wasn&#8217;t ready for how effective this mask was! My skin was smooth and clear, my underground sebum deposits were smaller, and my nose pores looked so clean. The work on the hard little sebum bumps was especially impressive; I&#8217;ve never seen a mask make  a noticeable difference on those before! Those disgusting little beads of oil are my #1 annoyance right now, so this turned me into repeat customer. Next time, I&#8217;m buying the whole box!</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><em><a href="http://www.sephora.com/100-percent-pure-argan-oil-P218700?skuId=1121797">Sephora, 1.7 oz., $48</a></em></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">
<p style="text-align: left;">Do people still say other people are &#8220;sprung?&#8221; Do people still get sprung? Can you be sprung on things that aren&#8217;t other people or their crotches? I&#8217;m not sure about the answer to any of these questions, so I&#8217;m going to take a big risk here when I say I am sprung on this Josie Maran Argan Oil.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>BOI-OI-OI-OING!!!!!</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">That was the sound of me being sprung!! This blog is so high tech and interactive! Now, imagine you can smell lavender Febreze and chihuahua kisses&#8230;that&#8217;s right&#8230;..immerse yourself in the sounds and smells of my world.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">I got a deluxe sample bottle of this Argan oil at Sephora a little over a month ago, and I am straight up obsessed. Although the bottle was small, it provided enough oil to find out that I love this product. I&#8217;ve been using it about twice a day, morning and evening, since I got it, and it has made a huge improvement  in my skin. I actually started using it in the first place because I was desperate. For the last couple months, my skin has been really off; it&#8217;s been dry, patchy, really uneven and super dull. My skin even looked yucky under my makeup! Foundation would cake up, or settle into creases. I HAD CREASES. It was bad. On top of THAT, I grew this zit on my chin that was throbbing, underground, and about the size of a pencil eraser.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Wait. Everyone knows what a pencil is, right? How old is everyone? Are pencils obsolete? Probably. Pencils were pretty obsolete 20 years ago. PENS FOREVER!!!</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Are pens obsolete? Don&#8217;t care! I&#8217;ll never stop admiring my own name when written with a fancy pen.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Back to the face oil!</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Like I said, since I&#8217;ve been using this oil, my skin has made a huge turnaround. It&#8217;s soft, smooth, bright, clear, and definitely younger looking. I even went out to fancy dinner and a show last week without wearing any face makeup! I just put on my oil after my shower, threw on some bronzer, and that was it. I looked like a gotdanged natural angel. This oil makes my skin, like, luminous. It works SO WELL, that I keep expecting strangers to come up to me out in public and demand to know what makeup I have on. Then, I&#8217;d be all, &#8220;I&#8217;m not wearing any makeup!&#8221; And they&#8217;ll be all, &#8220;What!? You&#8217;re so inherently beautiful! Here. Have a town car, chauffeur, and a modeling contract!&#8221; It hasn&#8217;t happened yet, but, like I said, I&#8217;ve only been using this oil for a month.</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">Today&#8217;s post is going to be all about my current skin care regimen. So, I decided to get right to the point and show you a photo of my makeup free face. There it is. I&#8217;m not going to do that thing where I act like I&#8217;m super grossed out by my own bare face, because, I&#8217;m not. I think I look fine without any makeup on, I just think I look better when I&#8217;m wearing mascara.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Right now, I&#8217;m pretty happy with my skin. The texture is good, the overall tone is decent. I rarely get blemishes. It&#8217;s not perfect, as you can see, I have some dark spots. I also have a little bit of redness around my nose, but that could just be hormonal. I *did* have a giant pimple above my top lip, right in the center last week. It literally popped up out of nowhere. I did my makeup, then I got in the car to leave, and suddenly, there was this huge, pulsing zit. It really gave me a lot of trouble, but it&#8217;s gone now. Unfortunately, it left some scarring/discoloration behind. This is a new thing for me. Over the last year or so, my skin has changed a lot, and I think it&#8217;s an age thing. My mom has the same problem with scarring and hyperpigmentation when she gets a particularly troublesome blemish. Whatcha gonna do? I just gotta roll with it, and try to find the best products for my changing skin.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="aligncenter  wp-image-886" alt="skin care products" src="/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/skin-care-products.jpg" width="823" height="617" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/skin-care-products.jpg 3264w, /wp-content/uploads/2014/01/skin-care-products-300x225.jpg 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2014/01/skin-care-products-1024x768.jpg 1024w, /wp-content/uploads/2014/01/skin-care-products-1272x954.jpg 1272w" sizes="(max-width: 823px) 100vw, 823px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">These are the products I&#8217;m currently using. As you can see, I&#8217;m not into buying an entire skin care system from the same line. I think all of our skin is so different, it can sometimes be best to mix and match. You do have to be careful when you do this though, because some ingredients can interact weirdly, or cancel each other out. Do your due diligence and research that shit! I always read tons of reviews and information before I buy a new skin care product. It doesn&#8217;t always keep me from making a mistake, but I make them less often. When things go wrong, and they sometimes will, I just pull the new product and go back to what I was doing before. I let my skin settle down, and I try again. It&#8217;s an ongoing process, but I enjoy it. Also, I really know everyone&#8217;s return policies.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Let&#8217;s take a look at my ALL-STARS! LEFT TO RIGHT, Y&#8217;ALL!</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><a href="&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00AU9EBTC/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B00AU9EBTC&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=thlabu-20&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://ir-na.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?t=thlabu-20&amp;l=as2&amp;o=1&amp;a=B00AU9EBTC&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; style=&quot;border:none !important; margin:0px !important;&quot; /&gt;">Fresh Soy Face Cleanser</a> &#8211; I did a <a title="Fresh Soy Face Cleanser" href="/fresh-soy-face-cleanser/">complete review</a> of this a few months ago, and I am still loving it. It&#8217;s such a nice, gentle cleanser. It doesn&#8217;t dry my skin out, and it keeps it clean. I&#8217;ve had this big bottle since June, and although I&#8217;m running low, I think I&#8217;ll make it through the end of this month. So, it&#8217;s not super cheap, but a little goes a long way. I pretty much only use this once a day, in the evenings. Either with, or without my Clarisonic. Hey, speaking of my Clarisonic&#8230;..</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><a href="http://www.clarisonic.com/shop-our-products/clarisonic-cleansing-devices">MY CLARISONIC!</a> &#8211; Remember <a title="Worth it! Clarisonic Brush" href="/worth-clarisonic-brush/">when I waxed rhapsodic about my Clarisonic?</a> I love this freaking thing so freaking much. I love how it removes allllll my makeup, I love how it keeps my skin so soft, I love how it scrubs all my little face crevices. As far as beauty products go, it&#8217;s sort of a big ticket item. But, I&#8217;ve said it before, and I&#8217;ll keep saying it forever, they&#8217;re totally worth it. I use mine every 2-3 days, and pretty much every time I need to clean off a full face of makeup.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><a href="http://www.pixibeauty.com/glow-tonic">Pixi Glow Tonic</a> &#8211; This baby is kind of new to the crew. I&#8217;ve been using it for about a month, and it&#8217;s been a great addition. It&#8217;s helped to clear up some rough patches, and my pores have stayed clearer. I use it every night, after I wash my face with my cleanser. I don&#8217;t wash my face with cleanser in the morning, I rinse with cool water, and then I follow that with this toner.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><a href="&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000A0ADT8/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B000A0ADT8&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=thlabu-20&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://ir-na.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?t=thlabu-20&amp;l=as2&amp;o=1&amp;a=B000A0ADT8&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; style=&quot;border:none !important; margin:0px !important;&quot; /&gt;">Ole Henriksen Truth Serum Collagen Booster</a> &amp; <a href="&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B007K6A1YC/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B007K6A1YC&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=thlabu-20&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://ir-na.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?t=thlabu-20&amp;l=as2&amp;o=1&amp;a=B007K6A1YC&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; style=&quot;border:none !important; margin:0px !important;&quot; /&gt;">Truth Creme</a> &#8211; I bought this set as my first shot fired in the war on my aging skin. I haven&#8217;t been using it long enough to see a difference in my dark spots, but I know I like the other things it&#8217;s doing. I use the serum first, then follow it with the creme. My skin feels soft and velvety, and it looks plump and bright. I use this system most nights, before bed.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><a href="http://www.ulta.com/ulta/browse/productDetail.jsp?productId=xlsImpprod6200687">Mario Badescu Rose Hips Nourishing Oil</a> &#8211;  I&#8217;ve <a title="Mario Badescu Rose Hips Nourishing Oil" href="/mario-badescu-rose-hips-nourishing-oil/">written about this here before</a>. At first, I thought this product was kind of strange. But, the longer I use it, the more I love it. Although it&#8217;s an oil, it isn&#8217;t greasy. It&#8217;s got sort of a watery consistency, and it just sucks up moisture. It sucks it all up into your skin. I can&#8217;t get enough of how good this makes my skin feel! It has helped immensely with my dry patches, and my flakiness. I use this, in the morning, on its own; and I use it under my moisturizers and treatment oil.</p>
<p><a href="&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0063NKM6K/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B0063NKM6K&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=thlabu-20&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://ir-na.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?t=thlabu-20&amp;l=as2&amp;o=1&amp;a=B0063NKM6K&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; style=&quot;border:none !important; margin:0px !important;&quot; /&gt;">Badger Damascus Rose Antioxidant Face Oil</a> &#8211; This is my treatment oil! I use this on the nights I don&#8217;t use my Ole Henriksen products, and whenever I feel like my skin needs some deep hydration. It feels nice, the price is right, and it lasts a long time!</p>
<p><a href="http://www.sephora.com/youthmud-tinglexfoliate-treatment-P375741?icid2=GlamGlow_Bestsellers_Carousel_P375741_link">Glam Glow Tingling and Exfoliating Mask</a> &#8211; <a title="GlamGlow Tingling &amp; Exfoliating Mud Mask Review" href="/glamglow-tingling-exfoliating-mud-mask-review/">I&#8217;ve covered this mask here before, too.</a> After I ran through my initial sample, I bought the small jar during the Sephora Friends &amp; Family sale. I&#8217;ve used it once a week since then, and it has really helped to keep my skin looking clear. I credit this mask for helping to keep my nose pores under control. Those bad boys act up whenever they can. Jerks.</p>
<p>There it is! The system, the systo, the systrain! It&#8217;s all trial and error, guys. You just keep looking and trying and until you find the products that work for you. It takes time, but it&#8217;s worth it.</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-676" alt="wine and cookie" src="/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/wine-and-cookie-1024x768.jpg" width="696" height="522" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/wine-and-cookie-1024x768.jpg 1024w, /wp-content/uploads/2013/10/wine-and-cookie-300x225.jpg 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2013/10/wine-and-cookie-1272x954.jpg 1272w" sizes="(max-width: 696px) 100vw, 696px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><i>MOMMY NEEDS HER MEDICINE.</i></p>
<p>Look at me!! I&#8217;m Hemingway!! Blah, blah, bullfights, blah, blah cats, blah blah Key West, blah blah blah big sweaters, blah blah blah blah I&#8217;m drunk and everyone loves me!</p>
<p>Anyways, I was just reading something on another site, and the author of the article casually mentioned her shower routine. It went like this: rinse, shampoo, wash face, wash body, conditioner. I don&#8217;t want to write one of those &#8220;the way you do this totally normal thing is wrong&#8221; pieces, but that&#8217;s wrong. I&#8217;m sorry. It&#8217;s wrong.</p>
<p>I was shocked by it, actually! It&#8217;s one of those things that I assume everyone knows.</p>
<p>Maybe I just have too much time on my hands, so I spend too much time thinking about dumb shit, but there&#8217;s a reason that shower order is wrong.</p>
<p>Conditioner.</p>
<p>Conditioner, your face bumps and YOU!</p>
<p>You guys see how this is wrong, right? Conditioner is creamy grease for your hair. If you&#8217;re washing your face prior to conditioning your hair, you&#8217;re just re-greasing your face. You&#8217;re greasing your face in a steamy, wet, warm room, so your skin is good and receptive to all those extra deep conditioners, oils, cremes, whatever.</p>
<p>You really should be washing and conditioning your hair prior to washing your face or your body. That way, all your polluted hair soap, and conditioner runoff will be cascading down your dirty, dirty bodies, instead of your already clean bodies and faces. So, like, my routine goes: get everything wet, wash and condition my hair, wash my body, detail my butt, THEN I wash my face. Last.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a really small change that can make a big difference; especially if you have persistent bumps around your hairline, jaw and chin.</p>
<p>Ok. That&#8217;s it. I&#8217;m going to schedule this to go up in the morning and go back to my wine, drugs and cookies. You can&#8217;t have any wine until you finish all your drug cookies!</p>
<p>Meown.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Mario Badescu Drying Cream, $14</em></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Let&#8217;s keep this short and sweet. This stuff totally works. You should buy it.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-236" alt="thumbsup" src="/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/thumbsup-300x236.jpg" width="300" height="236" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/thumbsup-300x236.jpg 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2013/05/thumbsup.jpg 608w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Hahaha! Jay kay! You know I can&#8217;t stop talking. But, since I&#8217;m on last minute vacation with my MANTASTIC MANIMAL, I am going to keep this short, by my standards.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">I got a little sample jar of Mario Badescu&#8217;s Drying Cream at Ulta last week. It was a gift with purchase sample, obviously, since yet another shitty thing about Ulta is their refusal to give out samples.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Ulta &#8211; 1, Sephora &#8211; 1,000</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">I gave Ulta a point because they never had me in for a bunch of interviews, talked scheduling with me, and then DIDN&#8217;T HIRE ME. Minus one point from Sephora, plus one for Ulta.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Anyways, that was years ago, I&#8217;m past all that now. My righteous anger boycott of Sephora only lasted a couple weeks.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Mario Badescu Drying Cream is a blemish cream that dries up your zits so you can move on with your life. Most blemish creams dry up and flake off once they&#8217;re on your skin; this one is sort of weird because it&#8217;s creamy like makeup, and it stays that way on your face. Their site says you can use it under your makeup to conceal and heal your blemishes, so that&#8217;s pretty cool. On Wednesday, I got this really angry looking pimple on the side of my nose. It was really big, like the tip of a pencil eraser. And, of course, I couldn&#8217;t stop touching it, even thought I totally know better. Before I went to bed that night, I remembered I had the Drying Cream, so I put a little on my zit. When I woke up in the morning, it was almost completely gone! It had shrunk way down to just a little dot, and it wasn&#8217;t red and pulsating anymore. Science is amazing, right? No more having to suffer through embarrassing adult pizza face. The only down side was, since it doesn&#8217;t dry down, it&#8217;s easy to smear. The first night I had it on, I kept saying to myself, &#8220;What is that weird smell?&#8221; and wiping my nose, like an idiot. It doesn&#8217;t actually smell weird, I&#8217;m just forgetful.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">I love this product! It&#8217;s really fantastic. But, the joke&#8217;s on them! I only used a teeeeeeny bit, and it worked right away. I&#8217;m going to use this free sample forever!</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">For some reason, Mario Badescu doesn&#8217;t allow Sephora and Ulta to promote these on their websites. So, you can buy Drying Cream directly from Mario Badescu&#8217;s site, <strong><a href="http://www.mariobadescu.com/Drying-Cream">HERE</a></strong>. Or, you can buy it in store at Sephora and Ulta.</p>
