<p>I&#8217;ve been working on this post for days! I&#8217;ve just been really distracted with, like, the Olympics, and learning to play ping pong, and I&#8217;ve had on pants and a bra SO MUCH this week, which is really, very unusual. Being seen in public a lot = less time sitting in front of my laptop. Also, I think I was telling myself this post might suck and second guessing myself tons, so I was making everything more difficult. That&#8217;s just maybe laziness disguised as self esteem problems, though. I don&#8217;t know! I guess you guys will be the judge. If it sucks, I was right, and if it doesn&#8217;t suck, I&#8217;m maybe lazy, or I maybe have self esteem problems, or, maybe both. Let&#8217;s find out!</p>
<p>Last week, I finally got around to grabbing a few of those Maybelline Color Tattoo cream shadows, and now I am OBSESSED. I hate that I&#8217;ve been not buying them all this time! They&#8217;re so easy to work with, and the color is long lasting. I&#8217;ve used them almost every day since I got them, and I have fully planned to buy several more.</p>
<p>Today, I want to show you two looks I&#8217;ve done, using the same colors. Since the colors and placement are the same, the looks are similar, but they&#8217;re both so pretty and wearable, I had to show you guys both.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter  wp-image-937" alt="Color Tattoo Looks products" src="/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/Color-Tattoo-Looks-products-e1392915925502.jpg" width="783" height="587" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/Color-Tattoo-Looks-products-e1392915925502.jpg 1632w, /wp-content/uploads/2014/02/Color-Tattoo-Looks-products-e1392915925502-300x225.jpg 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2014/02/Color-Tattoo-Looks-products-e1392915925502-1024x768.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 783px) 100vw, 783px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">These are the colors I used for these looks. We&#8217;ve got <strong>W.O.S.</strong> from Urban Decay&#8217;s Naked Basics palette, Maybelline Color Tattoo cream shadows in <strong>Barely Branded</strong> and <strong>Tough as Taupe</strong>, and a Coastal Scents shadow in <strong>Wild Raisin</strong>.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter  wp-image-945" alt="color tattoo looks swatches" src="/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/color-tattoo-looks-swatches.jpg" width="768" height="476" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/color-tattoo-looks-swatches.jpg 1280w, /wp-content/uploads/2014/02/color-tattoo-looks-swatches-300x186.jpg 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2014/02/color-tattoo-looks-swatches-1024x635.jpg 1024w, /wp-content/uploads/2014/02/color-tattoo-looks-swatches-1272x789.jpg 1272w" sizes="(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>L-R: Costa Riche liner, W.O.S, Tough as Taupe, Barely Branded, Wild Raisin</em></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Before I begin, I always use my Urban Decay Primer Potion. Then, on the first look only, I used W.O.S. on the entire lid; just to even out the skin, and to give the cream shadow something else behind it. Now for the fun part!</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="aligncenter  wp-image-939" alt="color tattoo look steps" src="/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/color-tattoo-look-steps.jpg" width="538" height="538" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/color-tattoo-look-steps.jpg 1280w, /wp-content/uploads/2014/02/color-tattoo-look-steps-150x150.jpg 150w, /wp-content/uploads/2014/02/color-tattoo-look-steps-300x300.jpg 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2014/02/color-tattoo-look-steps-1024x1024.jpg 1024w, /wp-content/uploads/2014/02/color-tattoo-look-steps-1272x1272.jpg 1272w" sizes="(max-width: 538px) 100vw, 538px" /></p>
<ol>
<li>Using a flatter brush, I applied Tough as Taupe over the lid, just to the crease.</li>
<li>Line the upper lash line and water line with a dark brown or grey liner; I used MAC&#8217;s Costa Riche. Smudge the line.</li>
<li>Using the pads of your fingers, gently pat Barely Branded around the edges of Tough as Taupe, blending upwards and onto the brow bone.</li>
<li>Apply Wild Raisin to the crease and the outer corner of the eye, then BLEND THE HELL OUT OF IT.</li>
</ol>
<p>And that&#8217;s it! If you want, you can lightly line your bottom lash line with the liner or the remaining product on the flat brush from the first step. Add some mascara, and you&#8217;re done!</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="aligncenter  wp-image-940" alt="color tattoo look 1" src="/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/color-tattoo-look-1.jpg" width="518" height="691" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/color-tattoo-look-1.jpg 960w, /wp-content/uploads/2014/02/color-tattoo-look-1-225x300.jpg 225w, /wp-content/uploads/2014/02/color-tattoo-look-1-768x1024.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 518px) 100vw, 518px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Lips: UD&#8217;s Naked</em></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Look Two is exactly the same as Look One, except you switch Wild Raisin and Tough as Taupe. So, Wild Raisin will cover your lid, and Tough as Taupe will get blended into the crease. It looks like this:</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="aligncenter  wp-image-941" alt="color tattoo look 2 detail" src="/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/color-tattoo-look-2-detail.jpg" width="518" height="691" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/color-tattoo-look-2-detail.jpg 960w, /wp-content/uploads/2014/02/color-tattoo-look-2-detail-225x300.jpg 225w, /wp-content/uploads/2014/02/color-tattoo-look-2-detail-768x1024.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 518px) 100vw, 518px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Lips: UD&#8217;s Protest</em></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="aligncenter  wp-image-943" alt="color tattoo look 2 close" src="/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/color-tattoo-look-2-close1.jpg" width="518" height="691" /></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">I&#8217;ve worn my makeup one of these two ways almost every day since last Friday. I just love how easy and flattering it is! And how awesome is it that these shadows are super cheap? I guess the Naked palette isn&#8217;t super cheap, but that color is also sort of unnecessary to the look, so who cares?! I&#8217;ve been doing this blog for almost a year, and the one thing I&#8217;ve learned is that my makeup snobbery has been keeping me from a lot of good makeup. Maybelline, in particular, has become a new favorite of mine. I never ever thought I&#8217;d be searching everywhere for a particular drugstore product like I do with high end brands, but here I am. It&#8217;s cool though, you know. Cheap products means more products, and Maybelline is always on sale, AND you can use your Ulta coupons on their stuff. I&#8217;m rolling in affordable cream shadows over here!</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">What do you guys think? Do you have any questions?</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Buy Maybelline Color Tattoo shadows basically everywhere.<br />

<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://www.target.com/p/maybelline-color-sensational-lip-color/-/A-14081992#prodSlot=large_1_8"><em>Target, $4.99</em></a></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Is it tacky that I shot this photo after I had already used the lipstick? I took another one before I tried it, but it didn&#8217;t come out like I was hoping, so I went for round two. Just pretend this is totally new and you can&#8217;t tell the angle I apply my lipstick.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Shhhh&#8230;.just pretend&#8230;shhh&#8230;..there you go&#8230;.mama&#8217;s got you&#8230;.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">I have been ON these Maybelline lipsticks for the last six months, or so. They&#8217;re so cheap, and shockingly luxe! The coverage is always great, and they&#8217;re so moisturizing and creamy, they&#8217;re totally comfortable to wear. I&#8217;ve never been so impressed by a drugstore brand. Great work, Maybelline! Keep it up!</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">I grabbed Darkest Cherry because I wanted a burgundy sort of color that was less intense than my <a title="OCC Lip Tar All-Star Mini x 4 Set: Anime &amp; Black Dahlia" href="/occ-lip-tar-star-mini-x-4-set-anime-black-dahlia/">OCC Lip Tar</a>. My Lip Tar is great, but they&#8217;re not therapeutic in any way, and sometimes, I just don&#8217;t feel up to fussing with that little brush. Just let me slap it on!!</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="aligncenter  wp-image-870" alt="maybelline deepest cherry swatch" src="/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/maybelline-deepest-cherry-swatch-1024x674.jpg" width="487" height="321" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/maybelline-deepest-cherry-swatch-1024x674.jpg 1024w, /wp-content/uploads/2014/01/maybelline-deepest-cherry-swatch-300x197.jpg 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2014/01/maybelline-deepest-cherry-swatch-1272x838.jpg 1272w" sizes="(max-width: 487px) 100vw, 487px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Deepest Cherry is a perfectly vampy, oxblood color. It doesn&#8217;t really skew purple or pink, it&#8217;s a pretty solid reddish brown; it&#8217;s lovely for Fall/Winter. It gives me so many 90s feelings though! I&#8217;m not saying I have to fight the urge to use a brown liner with this, but I&#8217;ve thought about it.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="aligncenter  wp-image-871" alt="maybelline deepest cherry face" src="/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/maybelline-deepest-cherry-face-768x1024.jpg" width="557" height="742" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/maybelline-deepest-cherry-face-768x1024.jpg 768w, /wp-content/uploads/2014/01/maybelline-deepest-cherry-face-225x300.jpg 225w, /wp-content/uploads/2014/01/maybelline-deepest-cherry-face.jpg 960w" sizes="(max-width: 557px) 100vw, 557px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Jason on my hair like this: &#8220;It looks like Helena Bonham Carter!&#8221;</em></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">This color is so gorgeous, right?! It&#8217;s dark but not so dark you look like you fell out of The Craft. Like I said, the formula is amazing. A lot of colors in this family can apply patchy and uneven, but this one is a dream. It slides right on without any tugging or skipping, and it doesn&#8217;t leave any lines when you press your lips together.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="aligncenter  wp-image-872" alt="maybelline deepest cherry lips" src="/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/maybelline-deepest-cherry-lips-e1389034616467.jpg" width="566" height="242" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/maybelline-deepest-cherry-lips-e1389034616467.jpg 944w, /wp-content/uploads/2014/01/maybelline-deepest-cherry-lips-e1389034616467-300x128.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 566px) 100vw, 566px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>NO TOUCHING!</em></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><em></em>The wear time is pretty average, a few hours without eating or drinking, but, that&#8217;s a fair trade when you get so much hydration. I love how my lips feel when I wear these lipsticks. They&#8217;re really great, and I can&#8217;t stop buying them!! THANK GOD they&#8217;re so cheap, or I&#8217;d be in some real trouble. Maybelline is coming out with a range of nude colors in this line, and I can&#8217;t wait to get my hands on them!</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">As a special bonus, here&#8217;s a better picture of my bee pins:</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="aligncenter  wp-image-873" alt="bee pins" src="/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/bee-pins.jpg" width="576" height="768" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/bee-pins.jpg 960w, /wp-content/uploads/2014/01/bee-pins-225x300.jpg 225w, /wp-content/uploads/2014/01/bee-pins-768x1024.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 576px) 100vw, 576px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">I figured you&#8217;d want to see! They&#8217;re so cute, I can&#8217;t stand it!! They were a birthday gift from a good friend who was genius enough to scope out my Pinterest page for ideas. Whenever I think my hair needs a little something extra, I just pop in my bee pins, sit back, and let the compliments roll in.</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">I know I&#8217;ve been on a lip color kick lately. I know this. I just can&#8217;t help myself! I love lip stuff! Lipstick is mostly my jam, because I HATE getting my hair stuck in a sticky lipgloss pout. But, BUT&#8230;.this new lipgloss from Maybelline has me rethinking my lip life choices.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Maybelline has really stepped up the drugstore lip game as of late. After <a title="Maybelline Fuchsia Flash Color Sensational Vivids Review" href="/maybelline-fuchsia-flash-color-sensational-vivids-review/">I loved their Vivids line</a>, I was really excited to try out this Color Elixir line. Maybelline Color Elixir Lipgloss is a FABULOUS lip product. It has pigmentation like lipstick, slides on like lipgloss, and hydrates like a lip balm. The gloss feels cushiony without feeling too sticky. It does leave a little bit of transfer lines when you press your lips together, but I&#8217;ve found that after the gloss sits on your lips for a few minutes, that problem sort of goes away. Wear time isn&#8217;t crazy long, but when a gloss feels this good to apply, that&#8217;s ok! The wand&#8217;s mega soft tip makes for easy, precise application, and the color has a slight perfume smell that I actually like. I usually hate that kind of thing, but this one smells really good! It reminds me of something, and I can&#8217;t place it. It&#8217;s making me slightly crazy, but I&#8217;ll figure it out. Don&#8217;t worry.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Indoors and in the sun.</em></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">I picked up this particular color, because of course I did. I pass by lip displays, I go into a trance, and my hands act on their own; just grabbing all the purple lip products. When I come to, they&#8217;re in my basket, and I&#8217;m like, &#8220;YEAH. GOOD WORK, ME!&#8221; Then, I move on to semi-consciously buying thousands of nail polishes that I&#8217;ll never wear. I might have a problem. Well, I guess it&#8217;s not a problem for me. I like it.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="aligncenter  wp-image-804" alt="maybelline elixir vision in violet face" src="/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/maybelline-elixir-vision-in-violet-face-768x1024.jpg" width="557" height="742" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/maybelline-elixir-vision-in-violet-face-768x1024.jpg 768w, /wp-content/uploads/2013/12/maybelline-elixir-vision-in-violet-face-225x300.jpg 225w, /wp-content/uploads/2013/12/maybelline-elixir-vision-in-violet-face.jpg 960w" sizes="(max-width: 557px) 100vw, 557px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Model mouth, civilian hair.</em></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">I freaking love this color. Vision in Violet is a sort of pink, orchid purple. It&#8217;s bright, it&#8217;s gorgeous, it&#8217;s eye catching! I wore it out running errands with a friend who&#8217;s colorblind, and he said, &#8220;Whoa! That lipstick is PURPLE!&#8221; I was like, hell yeah, it is! So, it healed him. My beautiful, bright, shiny mouth healed his colorblindness, and now his whole life is so much better all because I can&#8217;t stop buying lipgloss. HALLELOO!</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">The price on these colors is great, and totally worth it. Even when they wear down, and don&#8217;t look as glossy, the color is still really pretty. Also, I did not get a bunch of hair caught in my lips. That&#8217;s the worst, because then I&#8217;m walking around all unaware about the lashes of lipgloss color flicked all around my mouth and cheeks by my idiot, unruly hair. I can&#8217;t have that. I gotta keep rep, bro!</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Pick up these colors at Ulta, Target, and most likely wherever else you can buy a better than usual array of drugstore cosmetics. CVS, probably? Yeah, get some ice cream while you&#8217;re at it.</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">I totally used this lipstick before I took product photos. I was just so excited!</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">I don&#8217;t buy a lot of drugstore lipsticks. But, for the sake of diversity, and my bank account, I&#8217;ve come around. So far, I&#8217;ve been pretty pleasantly surprised! This lipstick by Maybelline is so great, it gained entrance into the back pocket of my purse alongside my Givenchy lip gloss. Which means I like it so much, I&#8217;m willing to carry it around with me all the time. It also means I loved the color so much, I want to have it available as an option at any time. Yes, sometimes I leave the house without finishing my face. But that&#8217;s because I know I have a wide array of lip colors in my bag. Really, all the best stuff is in there.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Maybelline Color Sensational Vivids in Fuchsia Flash is an electric, bright fuchsia with blue undertones. It goes on creamy, glossy, and even with great coverage. The creamy texture does mean you&#8217;ll be able to see some lines if you press your lips together, but it isn&#8217;t noticeable, and it&#8217;s easy to even out. The glossy finish wears down to a satiny finish over a couple hours of wear. It&#8217;s not going to stick around through eating and drinking, but that&#8217;s ok. I don&#8217;t always need that. You do get quite a bit of hydration from the formula which is a great trade off for it not being super long wearing. If you&#8217;re not eating and drinking, you&#8217;ll get about 4 hours of wear out of an application.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">The neon color is crazy on trend for summer 2013, so if you don&#8217;t see yourself as the kind of person who will keep on wearing an electric magenta lipstick forever, this is a great option. I AM the kind of person who will wear an electric magenta lipstick forever, so the killer price has got me excited. Another great thing about this particular color is that it&#8217;s a nearly dead on dupe for MAC&#8217;s Candy Yum Yum. The finish on the MAC color is matte. That&#8217;s pretty much the only difference. You could blot down this Maybelline color easily to get the same look without the drying effect you&#8217;ll often get from a matte lipstick.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="aligncenter  wp-image-535" alt="Maybelline Fuchsia Flash photo" src="/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/Maybelline-Fuchsia-Flash-photo-724x1024.jpg" width="557" height="787" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/Maybelline-Fuchsia-Flash-photo-724x1024.jpg 724w, /wp-content/uploads/2013/08/Maybelline-Fuchsia-Flash-photo-212x300.jpg 212w, /wp-content/uploads/2013/08/Maybelline-Fuchsia-Flash-photo.jpg 866w" sizes="(max-width: 557px) 100vw, 557px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>My hair looks long!! Bonus!</em></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">One of the best things about bright lip colors like this, is you can leave the rest of your face pretty bare, and you still have a finished look. It&#8217;s awesome. Mascara, blush, lipstick, BAM! Out the door looking SUPA FLY.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">I just found a $2 off any Maybelline lip product coupon in a magazine, so I&#8217;m going to go snap up another one of these. It&#8217;s a good thing they only have the one blue based bright fuchsia. I just can&#8217;t seem to stop myself.</p>
