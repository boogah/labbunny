<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Dat liner doe.</em></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">I&#8217;m a sucker for a purple lip.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Purple eyeshadow, too. I&#8217;m a sucker for purple eyeshadow.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">PURPLE NAILS! Don&#8217;t even get me started!!</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Long story short; I guess purple is my favorite color.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Well&#8230;and black. Is leopard a color? No, that&#8217;s silly! Leopard is a neutral!</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">&#8220;Leopard is a neutral,&#8221; has been my life motto since I was 16. I figured it out, and never looked back.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">WE&#8217;RE NOT PREACHING THE JOYS OF LEOPARD, SARAH. REMEMBER YOUR FIVE Gs.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1082" src="/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/latrice-gif.gif" alt="latrice gif" width="500" height="280" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><span style="text-align: left;">GOOD GOD, GET A GRIP, GIRL. </span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">The look above mixes up a purple lip with a leopard top, so I was pretty into it.  The lip is MAC&#8217;s Heroine, a vibrant, red-based purple. This color was a cult hit that MAC brought back, and made a part of their permanent collection. That&#8217;s good news because I could really see myself finishing this tube of lipstick. I mean, as soon as it came home, I made it a part of MY permanent collection (the zipper pouch inside my purse).</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Heroine has a satin finish, and it wears down to a bright matte that has a lot of staying power. I really appreciate that in a lip color. I love to do my makeup, but, I really hate having to constantly reapply my lip. I&#8217;m a modern woman! I don&#8217;t have time for that kind of nonsense. I don&#8217;t have time, and, also, I forget. And, also, pizza.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Oh, man. Pizza sounds so good right now. What time is it? 9:15?!?! Pizza isn&#8217;t even open yet. That&#8217;s ok. Everyone knows the sweetest pizza is the one you have to wait for.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">This lip color goes with all my favorite faces; neutral eye/bold lip, bold eye/bold lip, glasses/bold lip.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter  wp-image-1081" src="/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/MAC-Heroine-x-glasses.jpg" alt="MAC Heroine x glasses" width="516" height="516" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/MAC-Heroine-x-glasses.jpg 960w, /wp-content/uploads/2014/09/MAC-Heroine-x-glasses-150x150.jpg 150w, /wp-content/uploads/2014/09/MAC-Heroine-x-glasses-300x300.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 516px) 100vw, 516px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Glasses/bold lip goes ANYWHERE, with EVERYTHING. I love it! If you wear glasses, and you want some compliments, do it. People fucking love it. If you don&#8217;t have glasses, I feel bad for you, you&#8217;re obviously a dum-dum. Everyone knows glasses make you super smart. Glasses are also the best way to hide your true beauty. When you take them off, everyone is super impressed by how good looking and popular you are! WOWZA.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">This post, you guys, it&#8217;s not so good. I&#8217;m sorry. I accidentally took a summer vacation, now I&#8217;m super rusty!</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="aligncenter  wp-image-1083" src="/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/Rusty.png" alt="Rusty" width="471" height="312" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/Rusty.png 400w, /wp-content/uploads/2014/09/Rusty-300x198.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 471px) 100vw, 471px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>ACTUAL SUPER RUSTY</em></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">That Rusty might be my favorite. I love the Anthony Michael Hall Rusty, but, this Rusty is hysterical to me. Those Rustys are tied for first? Second place is Nick Papagiorgio Rusty. David from Roseanne Rusty is neither here nor there for me.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><a href="http://www.maccosmetics.com/products/spp/shaded.tmpl?CATEGORY_ID=CAT168&amp;PRODUCT_ID=PROD310">Buy Heroine by MAC HERE or in stores.</a></p>

<p><strong>AUUUUUUUUUGGGGGGGGGGGHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</strong></p>
<p>MAC announced the Rocky Horror Fall collection, and I am SHIVERING WITH ANTICI&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">PATION!</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">I see a nail polish, a lipstick, and a couple glitters or pigments that I&#8217;m going to need. The collection drops online September 29th, and in stores on October 2nd. Lucky for me, that&#8217;s just a few days before my birthday! I think the traditional 33rd birthday present is Dr. Frank-N-Furter themed lipstick, so this works out great!</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><a href="http://www.temptalia.com/mac-x-rocky-horror-picture-show-collection-fall-2014">Temptalia has the full details, and photos. Go up to the lab, and see what&#8217;s on the slab! Check it out! </a></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: center;"> <img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="aligncenter  wp-image-938" alt="color tattoo looks diptic" src="/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/color-tattoo-looks-diptic.jpg" width="704" height="704" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/color-tattoo-looks-diptic.jpg 1632w, /wp-content/uploads/2014/02/color-tattoo-looks-diptic-150x150.jpg 150w, /wp-content/uploads/2014/02/color-tattoo-looks-diptic-300x300.jpg 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2014/02/color-tattoo-looks-diptic-1024x1024.jpg 1024w, /wp-content/uploads/2014/02/color-tattoo-looks-diptic-1272x1272.jpg 1272w" sizes="(max-width: 704px) 100vw, 704px" /></p>
<p>I&#8217;ve been working on this post for days! I&#8217;ve just been really distracted with, like, the Olympics, and learning to play ping pong, and I&#8217;ve had on pants and a bra SO MUCH this week, which is really, very unusual. Being seen in public a lot = less time sitting in front of my laptop. Also, I think I was telling myself this post might suck and second guessing myself tons, so I was making everything more difficult. That&#8217;s just maybe laziness disguised as self esteem problems, though. I don&#8217;t know! I guess you guys will be the judge. If it sucks, I was right, and if it doesn&#8217;t suck, I&#8217;m maybe lazy, or I maybe have self esteem problems, or, maybe both. Let&#8217;s find out!</p>
<p>Last week, I finally got around to grabbing a few of those Maybelline Color Tattoo cream shadows, and now I am OBSESSED. I hate that I&#8217;ve been not buying them all this time! They&#8217;re so easy to work with, and the color is long lasting. I&#8217;ve used them almost every day since I got them, and I have fully planned to buy several more.</p>
<p>Today, I want to show you two looks I&#8217;ve done, using the same colors. Since the colors and placement are the same, the looks are similar, but they&#8217;re both so pretty and wearable, I had to show you guys both.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="aligncenter  wp-image-937" alt="Color Tattoo Looks products" src="/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/Color-Tattoo-Looks-products-e1392915925502.jpg" width="783" height="587" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/Color-Tattoo-Looks-products-e1392915925502.jpg 1632w, /wp-content/uploads/2014/02/Color-Tattoo-Looks-products-e1392915925502-300x225.jpg 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2014/02/Color-Tattoo-Looks-products-e1392915925502-1024x768.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 783px) 100vw, 783px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">These are the colors I used for these looks. We&#8217;ve got <strong>W.O.S.</strong> from Urban Decay&#8217;s Naked Basics palette, Maybelline Color Tattoo cream shadows in <strong>Barely Branded</strong> and <strong>Tough as Taupe</strong>, and a Coastal Scents shadow in <strong>Wild Raisin</strong>.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="aligncenter  wp-image-945" alt="color tattoo looks swatches" src="/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/color-tattoo-looks-swatches.jpg" width="768" height="476" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/color-tattoo-looks-swatches.jpg 1280w, /wp-content/uploads/2014/02/color-tattoo-looks-swatches-300x186.jpg 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2014/02/color-tattoo-looks-swatches-1024x635.jpg 1024w, /wp-content/uploads/2014/02/color-tattoo-looks-swatches-1272x789.jpg 1272w" sizes="(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>L-R: Costa Riche liner, W.O.S, Tough as Taupe, Barely Branded, Wild Raisin</em></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Before I begin, I always use my Urban Decay Primer Potion. Then, on the first look only, I used W.O.S. on the entire lid; just to even out the skin, and to give the cream shadow something else behind it. Now for the fun part!</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="aligncenter  wp-image-939" alt="color tattoo look steps" src="/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/color-tattoo-look-steps.jpg" width="538" height="538" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/color-tattoo-look-steps.jpg 1280w, /wp-content/uploads/2014/02/color-tattoo-look-steps-150x150.jpg 150w, /wp-content/uploads/2014/02/color-tattoo-look-steps-300x300.jpg 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2014/02/color-tattoo-look-steps-1024x1024.jpg 1024w, /wp-content/uploads/2014/02/color-tattoo-look-steps-1272x1272.jpg 1272w" sizes="(max-width: 538px) 100vw, 538px" /></p>
<ol>
<li>Using a flatter brush, I applied Tough as Taupe over the lid, just to the crease.</li>
<li>Line the upper lash line and water line with a dark brown or grey liner; I used MAC&#8217;s Costa Riche. Smudge the line.</li>
<li>Using the pads of your fingers, gently pat Barely Branded around the edges of Tough as Taupe, blending upwards and onto the brow bone.</li>
<li>Apply Wild Raisin to the crease and the outer corner of the eye, then BLEND THE HELL OUT OF IT.</li>
</ol>
<p>And that&#8217;s it! If you want, you can lightly line your bottom lash line with the liner or the remaining product on the flat brush from the first step. Add some mascara, and you&#8217;re done!</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="aligncenter  wp-image-940" alt="color tattoo look 1" src="/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/color-tattoo-look-1.jpg" width="518" height="691" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/color-tattoo-look-1.jpg 960w, /wp-content/uploads/2014/02/color-tattoo-look-1-225x300.jpg 225w, /wp-content/uploads/2014/02/color-tattoo-look-1-768x1024.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 518px) 100vw, 518px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Lips: UD&#8217;s Naked</em></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Look Two is exactly the same as Look One, except you switch Wild Raisin and Tough as Taupe. So, Wild Raisin will cover your lid, and Tough as Taupe will get blended into the crease. It looks like this:</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="aligncenter  wp-image-941" alt="color tattoo look 2 detail" src="/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/color-tattoo-look-2-detail.jpg" width="518" height="691" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/color-tattoo-look-2-detail.jpg 960w, /wp-content/uploads/2014/02/color-tattoo-look-2-detail-225x300.jpg 225w, /wp-content/uploads/2014/02/color-tattoo-look-2-detail-768x1024.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 518px) 100vw, 518px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Lips: UD&#8217;s Protest</em></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="aligncenter  wp-image-943" alt="color tattoo look 2 close" src="/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/color-tattoo-look-2-close1.jpg" width="518" height="691" /></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">I&#8217;ve worn my makeup one of these two ways almost every day since last Friday. I just love how easy and flattering it is! And how awesome is it that these shadows are super cheap? I guess the Naked palette isn&#8217;t super cheap, but that color is also sort of unnecessary to the look, so who cares?! I&#8217;ve been doing this blog for almost a year, and the one thing I&#8217;ve learned is that my makeup snobbery has been keeping me from a lot of good makeup. Maybelline, in particular, has become a new favorite of mine. I never ever thought I&#8217;d be searching everywhere for a particular drugstore product like I do with high end brands, but here I am. It&#8217;s cool though, you know. Cheap products means more products, and Maybelline is always on sale, AND you can use your Ulta coupons on their stuff. I&#8217;m rolling in affordable cream shadows over here!</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">What do you guys think? Do you have any questions?</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Buy Maybelline Color Tattoo shadows basically everywhere.<br />

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Everyone has their favorite facial feature, and mine are definitely my lips. I like to look at them, I like to call attention to them, I love to play them up. It&#8217;s no secret that I buy A LOT of lipstick. And I won&#8217;t stop, cuz I can&#8217;t stop. ::Puffy Dance::</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-897" alt="chapelle dance" src="/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/chapelle-dance.gif" width="500" height="340" /></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Because I am obsessed with my own mouth, when I paint it, I paint it with love. I also paint it with focus because I am always teetering close to the edge of crazy mouth. I gots all my tricks down, and I want to share them with you today. First, let&#8217;s take a look at my bare mouth.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="aligncenter  wp-image-898" alt="bare mouth" src="/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/bare-mouth.jpg" width="461" height="354" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/bare-mouth.jpg 960w, /wp-content/uploads/2014/01/bare-mouth-300x230.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 461px) 100vw, 461px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Not bad, not bad. A little chewed, but nothing gross. Hydrated, exfoliated, I tweezed my mustache and got my one old lady chin hair. So, this is pretty much best case scenario. What I want to do is bring up the perimeters of my lips, shade where I want depth, and highlight where I want light. Although these steps can be used with pretty much any color, I&#8217;m going to demonstrate with a nude lip. Nude lips usually need the extra dimension anyways, so it works out.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Here&#8217;s what I&#8217;m using:</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-899" alt="lip tools" src="/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/lip-tools.jpg" width="640" height="480" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/lip-tools.jpg 640w, /wp-content/uploads/2014/01/lip-tools-300x225.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>Chapstick Hydration Lock</strong> &#8211; Prime and lightly moisturize.<br />
<strong>MAC Prep + Prime Highlighter in Radiant Rose</strong> &#8211; Um. To highlight.<br />
<strong>Cover Girl Perfect Blend Pencil in Mink</strong> &#8211; Shading, lining and contouring.<br />
<strong>MAC Matte Lipstick in Honey Love</strong> &#8211; Very nude, cream matte lipstick. I used this color to do a 60s inspired look for my wedding.<br />
<strong>Marc Jacobs Lovemarc Lip Gel in Role Play</strong> &#8211; A creamy rosy nude with a glossy finish.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">OK. First, I lightly apply my Chapstick. I don&#8217;t want to use too much, because it can make everything tricky. So, I use just enough to make sure my lips are smooth. Then, I line around my lips with the brown liner.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="aligncenter  wp-image-900" alt="brown liner" src="/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/brown-liner.jpg" width="574" height="346" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/brown-liner.jpg 1182w, /wp-content/uploads/2014/01/brown-liner-300x180.jpg 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2014/01/brown-liner-1024x616.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 574px) 100vw, 574px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Do you see how things are already happening?! It&#8217;s so exciting! This liner is a pretty cool brown color, and it&#8217;s going to make the edges of my mouth recede, so my lips themselves really stand out in the center. Then, with the spongy thing on the other end of the pencil, I blend the line so it isn&#8217;t harsh and obvious.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Next, I use my Prep + Prime pen to highlight the area above my lip. You know, above your cupid&#8217;s bow, where that little divot is? There! Like, so:</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="aligncenter  wp-image-901" alt="lip highlight" src="/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/lip-highlight.jpg" width="576" height="479" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/lip-highlight.jpg 960w, /wp-content/uploads/2014/01/lip-highlight-300x249.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 576px) 100vw, 576px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">The highlighter above your lip like that will give your top lip that little bit of upwards flare that really gives you a good, pillowy mouth. Blend that highlight color, and, if you like, set it with a little translucent powder. This is also where I add a little color to that mole next to my lip and set that with powder too. When I remember.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">And now we&#8217;re ready for lipstick!!!! First, I&#8217;ll show you the glossier, Marc Jacobs color.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="aligncenter  wp-image-902" alt="lips role play" src="/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/lips-role-play.jpg" width="576" height="404" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/lips-role-play.jpg 960w, /wp-content/uploads/2014/01/lips-role-play-300x210.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 576px) 100vw, 576px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Pretty good, right?! The line around the corner edges of my bottom lip looks darker on me than it might on you because, as you can see in the very first picture, the edges of my lips are naturally darker. This color works great with this whole technique because the shine in the lipstick really makes lips pop. I love it. This lipstick has become one of my go-to colors.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Now, we&#8217;ll see how it looks with MAC&#8217;s matte Honey Love.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="aligncenter  wp-image-903" alt="lips honey love" src="/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/lips-honey-love.jpg" width="576" height="463" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/lips-honey-love.jpg 960w, /wp-content/uploads/2014/01/lips-honey-love-300x240.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 576px) 100vw, 576px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Faaaaaaaabulous!! I added a little bit of pink-gold gloss in the very center of my lips to add some more depth to the flat color. If you want a truly matte, 60s mouth, skip this part. Like I said, I like to play up my lips, so I usually add a little dab.  I used NARS lip gloss in Super Orgasm. I forgot to take a picture of it. My bad! It&#8217;s not super crucial for you to see it, so it&#8217;s cool.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">I think adding shading around the mouth isn&#8217;t something most people think to do, but it makes a difference. I didn&#8217;t think to do it for a long time! I mean, I didn&#8217;t invent any of these tricks, they&#8217;re just things I&#8217;ve picked up over the years, put all together, and turned into my system for lips. I hope this has been helpful to somebody! Air kisses!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: center;"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="aligncenter  wp-image-734" alt="occ lip tar set black dahlia" src="/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/occ-lip-tar-set-black-dahlia.jpg" width="672" height="896" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/occ-lip-tar-set-black-dahlia.jpg 960w, /wp-content/uploads/2013/11/occ-lip-tar-set-black-dahlia-225x300.jpg 225w, /wp-content/uploads/2013/11/occ-lip-tar-set-black-dahlia-768x1024.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 672px) 100vw, 672px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Witch-ay Woman</em></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">A commenter asked about the other makeup I&#8217;m wearing in this photo from <a title="OCC Lip Tar All-Star Mini x 4 Set: Anime &amp; Black Dahlia" href="/occ-lip-tar-star-mini-x-4-set-anime-black-dahlia/">my review of the OCC Lip Tar All-Star Mini set</a>. I was like, duh, I should probably start including that information along with my photos. I guess I probably never thought about it because I am the worst and I like to keep all my secrets to myself. Like, if you gush about my sunglasses and ask where I got them, I&#8217;ll tell you&#8211;but, inside, I really don&#8217;t want to. I know. That&#8217;s terrible. And it&#8217;s not even the grossest thing about me. Don&#8217;t worry, I get karma back on it. A couple months ago, I asked a lady at the farmers market where she got her sunglasses, and she was all, &#8220;I don&#8217;t remember.&#8221; And I was like, &#8220;Girl. Yeah, right.&#8221; It&#8217;s like Justin Timberlake says, &#8220;What goes around, goes around, goes around, comes all the way back around.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">So, the makeup in this picture!</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Eyes &#8211; It looks like I used three shadows for this look. From the original Urban Decay Naked palette, I used &#8220;Virgin&#8221; for the brow bone and &#8220;Half Baked&#8221; for the inner eye corners. The bulk of the shadow, the wine color, is from a very old TIGI Cosmetics palette. I tried to find it, and unfortunately, it doesn&#8217;t look like they make it anymore. I swear this is not me just trying not to tell. I bough the palette when I was in beauty school a million years ago, and I probably shouldn&#8217;t even be using it anymore. The color was just called, &#8220;Wine,&#8221; and it&#8217;s not very hard to dupe; any wine color that leans more towards a plum will do the trick. I used a white pencil liner from the Sephora collection on my lower waterline, and UD&#8217;s black pencil liner on my bottom lash line and upper waterline. The mascara is Benefit&#8217;s They&#8217;re Real.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Eyebrows &#8211; Anastasia Beverly Hills Brow Powder Duo in &#8220;Brunette/Dark Brown&#8221; is my go to brow product. I use a light mixture of the two colors on a thin angled brush.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Blush &#8211; &#8220;Peaches&#8221; Sheertone Blush by MAC.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Lips &#8211; OCC Lip Tar in &#8220;Black Dahlia&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">There you have it! I guess I really don&#8217;t mind telling about makeup and beauty stuff. I mean, if I did, I probably wouldn&#8217;t have started a beauty blog. So, the good news is, my shadiness only extends to accessories! The bad news is, I will never ever start a sunglasses and bracelets blog.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Just a little FYI&#8230;</p>
<p>You can go buy any pieces you want from MAC&#8217;s Fall collaboration with Rihanna right now, and pick them up tomorrow when they officially go on sale! I went down to the MAC counter at the mall this morning, and did just that. I only ordered one lipstick, since nothing else really tickled my fancy. The eyeshadow quads look great, but I have similar colors in other brands, and I just can&#8217;t justify the purchase. Oh! If you really want RiRi Woo, this might be a good way to try and get it.</p>
<p>I was in such a hurry to get to the MAC counter, that I didn&#8217;t pay attention to where I parked, and then when I came back out to the parking lot, I couldn&#8217;t find my car! And then I couldn&#8217;t find my keys. And <strong>then</strong> I knew for sure that I had dropped my keys walking in, and some slick car thief took my car and now my precious Corolla was being broken down for parts.</p>
<p>For a second there, I was a weirdo wandering aimlessly through the mall parking lot though. Some old lady even eyed me suspiciously! But then, I found my keys in a little pocket inside a little pocket in my bag, and I found my car in another part of the parking lot. So, crisis averted! Well, more crisis averted. I was already in a crisis when I thought I got our car stolen.</p>
<p>Go get yer RiRi on! Pay attention to where you parked!</p>

<p>MAC has brought back their original burgundy-red Viva Glam lipstick from 1994! With original Viva Glam SUPERMODEL OF THE WORLD, RuPaul!</p>
<p>I actually don&#8217;t have any of the Viva Glam lipsticks, but, I think the beginning is probably a good place to start. I&#8217;m into it! Ru is my Oprah, and as a person from the 90s, I have a deep understanding of burgundy lipsticks.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m going to buy it without even trying it on, because I know it doesn&#8217;t matter what I do, everything looks good on me. Supermodel.</p>
<p>Speaking of Ru and Supermodel, when was the last time you watched the &#8220;Supermodel&#8221; video?</p>
<p>http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vw9LOrHU8JI</p>
<p>Ru is everydamnthang in this video! She&#8217;s so fucking funny, it kills me! And the shout outs to all the 90&#8217;s Supermodels? LAWD, that makes my Evangelista loving heart skip a beat.</p>
<p>The 90&#8217;s were an amazing time. If you need more proof of this, allow me to take you to my happy place:</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-627" alt="ru and nirvana" src="/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/ru-and-nirvana.jpg" width="403" height="600" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/ru-and-nirvana.jpg 403w, /wp-content/uploads/2013/09/ru-and-nirvana-201x300.jpg 201w" sizes="(max-width: 403px) 100vw, 403px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>I just might make this my iphone screen.</em></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Feel free to use it as your happy place too. Whenever you feel bad, just do a Google image search for the Ru and Nirvana. There are all kinds of photos! Ru holding a crying Frances Bean and trying to console her?! DEAD. I AM DEAD NOW.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Am I off topic? We were talking about Viva Glam. We can talk about the 90s any time. We can talk about RuPaul all the time, if you want. I mean, I&#8217;ve been thinking about hugging her since 1993. True Story: Ru tweeted back to me once about Miss J, from ANTM, and I got dizzy. Worlds were colliding and I couldn&#8217;t take it.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><a href="http://www.maccosmetics.com/whats_new/11404/New-Collections/Viva-Glam-The-Original/index.tmpl">Buy Viva Glam The Original HERE. Every cent of the selling price ($15) goes towards helping people living with HIV/AIDS.</a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It&#8217;s my favorite fucking eyeshadow color of all time, ladies and gentlemen&#8230;.the hardest working shadow in HO BUSINESS&#8230;&#8230;</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"> <img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="aligncenter  wp-image-616" alt="mac trax 3" src="/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/mac-trax-3-962x1024.jpg" width="557" height="592" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/mac-trax-3-962x1024.jpg 962w, /wp-content/uploads/2013/09/mac-trax-3-281x300.jpg 281w, /wp-content/uploads/2013/09/mac-trax-3-1272x1353.jpg 1272w, /wp-content/uploads/2013/09/mac-trax-3.jpg 1924w" sizes="(max-width: 557px) 100vw, 557px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">MAC TRAX!!! ($15)</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Trax is a plummy-purple with a shifting gold shimmer to it. I&#8217;ve seen it described in other places online as a burgundy, but I really disagree with that.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">It&#8217;s so beautiful as a light wash of color, or built up darker as an alternative to a traditional smoky eye colors. I wear it alone a lot, or with one of my gold shadows in the inner corner of my eyes, or lightly added over the top to intensify the gold in Trax. Natural, or dramatic, it really is a brilliant, versatile color.</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">Doing makeup, I&#8217;ve used it on lots of different eye colors, and the result is always gorgeous. Purple is one of those colors that really makes a lot of other colors pop. Brown, green, blue, hazel&#8230;pretty much everyone looks good in purple and gold.</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">Trax is part of the permanent line at MAC, so you can just go pick it up. The color works in so many different ways, on so many different people, it would be a great addition to nearly every makeup bag. It&#8217;s like, my easiest way to look like I really did something to my makeup when I haven&#8217;t. Sometimes I use an aubergine colored pencil to line my eyes, sometimes I don&#8217;t, blush, mascara, nude gloss, BAM! FACE! I&#8217;M READY TO GO OUT!</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">I totally used this lipstick before I took product photos. I was just so excited!</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">I don&#8217;t buy a lot of drugstore lipsticks. But, for the sake of diversity, and my bank account, I&#8217;ve come around. So far, I&#8217;ve been pretty pleasantly surprised! This lipstick by Maybelline is so great, it gained entrance into the back pocket of my purse alongside my Givenchy lip gloss. Which means I like it so much, I&#8217;m willing to carry it around with me all the time. It also means I loved the color so much, I want to have it available as an option at any time. Yes, sometimes I leave the house without finishing my face. But that&#8217;s because I know I have a wide array of lip colors in my bag. Really, all the best stuff is in there.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Maybelline Color Sensational Vivids in Fuchsia Flash is an electric, bright fuchsia with blue undertones. It goes on creamy, glossy, and even with great coverage. The creamy texture does mean you&#8217;ll be able to see some lines if you press your lips together, but it isn&#8217;t noticeable, and it&#8217;s easy to even out. The glossy finish wears down to a satiny finish over a couple hours of wear. It&#8217;s not going to stick around through eating and drinking, but that&#8217;s ok. I don&#8217;t always need that. You do get quite a bit of hydration from the formula which is a great trade off for it not being super long wearing. If you&#8217;re not eating and drinking, you&#8217;ll get about 4 hours of wear out of an application.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">The neon color is crazy on trend for summer 2013, so if you don&#8217;t see yourself as the kind of person who will keep on wearing an electric magenta lipstick forever, this is a great option. I AM the kind of person who will wear an electric magenta lipstick forever, so the killer price has got me excited. Another great thing about this particular color is that it&#8217;s a nearly dead on dupe for MAC&#8217;s Candy Yum Yum. The finish on the MAC color is matte. That&#8217;s pretty much the only difference. You could blot down this Maybelline color easily to get the same look without the drying effect you&#8217;ll often get from a matte lipstick.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="aligncenter  wp-image-535" alt="Maybelline Fuchsia Flash photo" src="/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/Maybelline-Fuchsia-Flash-photo-724x1024.jpg" width="557" height="787" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/Maybelline-Fuchsia-Flash-photo-724x1024.jpg 724w, /wp-content/uploads/2013/08/Maybelline-Fuchsia-Flash-photo-212x300.jpg 212w, /wp-content/uploads/2013/08/Maybelline-Fuchsia-Flash-photo.jpg 866w" sizes="(max-width: 557px) 100vw, 557px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>My hair looks long!! Bonus!</em></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">One of the best things about bright lip colors like this, is you can leave the rest of your face pretty bare, and you still have a finished look. It&#8217;s awesome. Mascara, blush, lipstick, BAM! Out the door looking SUPA FLY.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">I just found a $2 off any Maybelline lip product coupon in a magazine, so I&#8217;m going to go snap up another one of these. It&#8217;s a good thing they only have the one blue based bright fuchsia. I just can&#8217;t seem to stop myself.</p>
