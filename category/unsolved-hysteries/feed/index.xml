<p>One of the best things about having this site is getting to see the summaries of search engine terms that bring people to the Lab Bunny every day. In this grab bag of internet psyche, some of the searches are hilarious, some are disturbing, and some are actually decent. Here are some little quickie answers to help with these UNSOLVED SEARCH HYSTERIES!!</p>
<p><em><strong>trader joe&#8217;s coconut body butter ingredients</strong></em></p>
<p>WHOA. I just flipped over my jar to check the list, and it is EXTENSIVE. Here we go&#8230;</p>
<p>purified water, cocos nucifera (coconut) oil, cetyl alcohol, caprice/caprylic triglyceride, glyceryl stearate se, glycerin, stearyl alcohol, butyrospermum, parkii (shea) butter, aloe barbadensis leaf juice*, salvia sclarea (clary) extract*, tocopheryl acetate (vitamin E), citrus grandis (grapefruit) fruit extract*, yucca schidigera extract*, dimethicone, citrus aurantium dulcis (orange) peel extract*, rosmarinus officinalis (rosemary) leaf extract*, althaea officinalis root (marshmallow) extract*, cymbopogon schoenanthus (lemongrass) extract*, carbomer, centella asiatica extract*, chamomilla recutita (matricaria) flower extract, polysorbate 20, humulus lupulus (hops) extract*, sodium benzoate, disodium edta, citrus medica limonum (lemon) peel extract*, equisetum arvense extract*, vaccinium myrtillus fruit/leaf extract, fragrance ethylhexylglycerin, phenoxyethanol, sodium hydroxide, potassium sorbate (*certified organic ingredients)</p>
<p>You guys. Where am I? Are those real words? If anyone wants to know what those words all mean exactly, I can&#8217;t help with that. Consult your local Wikipedia.</p>
<p><em><strong>is the neutrogena wave a vibrator</strong></em></p>
<p>Anything can be a vibrator if you want it bad enough! But, yes. <a title="Neutrogena Wave Vibrator" href="/neutrogena-wave-vibrator/">It&#8217;s definitely a vibrator.</a></p>
<p><em><strong>i cut thru my nail bed with a razor can i super glue it</strong></em></p>
<p>OH MY GOD ARE YOU OK?! I don&#8217;t know for sure if you can do this! Maybe? Super glue is used in a lot of medical offices in place of stitches, so, yeah, maybe. Nail glue is practically super glue, so I don&#8217;t really see why not. If you&#8217;re just trying to glue your nail back together, that&#8217;d probably work. I&#8217;d be afraid that my nail would always be stuck to the nail bed right there, and it would never grow out. But, what the fuck do I know?</p>
<p><em><strong>do nail wraps look cheap</strong></em></p>
<p>Some do! The wraps from <a href="http://www.shopncla.com/">NCLA</a> don&#8217;t! Those are my favorite wraps right now. Every design I&#8217;ve bought has looked sharp and clear. I mean, they have this set, <a href="http://www.shopncla.com/products/seeing-signs">Seeing Signs</a>, that actually looks like hundred dollar bills. So, yeah, those look really expensive!</p>
<p><em><strong>smeared lipstick on a dick</strong></em></p>
<p>Come on, man. What a waste of lipstick. Is this what you perverts are using the internet for?! Al Gore must be rolling over in his grave!</p>
<p><em><strong>big boobs lush pubes</strong></em></p>
<p>Put it on my headstone.</p>

<p>Keep on Googling with one hand, weirdos! I SEE YOU.</p>

<p>One of the best things about having this site is getting to see the summaries of search engine terms that bring people to the Lab Bunny every day. In this grab bag of internet psyche, some of the searches are hilarious, some are disturbing, and some are actually decent. I thought I&#8217;d do some little quickie answers to help with these UNSOLVED SEARCH HYSTERIES!!</p>
<p>&#8220;<b><i>is Trader Joe&#8217;s body butter good for face?&#8221;</i></b></p>
<p>I wouldn&#8217;t do that if I were you. Body lotions and face lotions have different ingredients and different properties. Even an all natural body lotion is probably going to be much heavier than anything you&#8217;d want to use on your face, and they probably aren&#8217;t non-comedogenic, so they&#8217;ll maybe block your pores. You only want to put lotions on your face that are non-comedogenic and, preferably, made specifically for faces.</p>
<p>&#8220;<em><strong>how to UD eyeshadow no glitter fallout&#8221;</strong></em></p>
<p>Those UD glitter eyeshadows are pretty notorious for their fallout. I getcha. They&#8217;ve worked to improve their formulas over the years, and I&#8217;ve found the fallout issue has improved, too. Improved does not equal no fallout though. These are the best things you can do to minimize glitter fallout from any brand of shadow: 1. If you&#8217;re doing a heavy glitter or dark shadow look that you know to be prone to fallout, do your eyes before doing your foundation, powder etc. It&#8217;s easier to clean up any mess that way, and you don&#8217;t have to redo anything that got smudged, or you had to wipe off. Â 2. Use a primer, or an epoxy. If you can, instead of layering different shadows underneath, apply the glitter shadow directly to your primered lid. 3. Use a flatter brush to press the glitter shadow onto your eye instead of brushing or swiping. You deposit more glitter that way, and you&#8217;re able to concentrate color with less distribution onto your cheeks and around your eyes. 4. Hold a folded tissue under your eye, against your cheek, to catch anything that drops. This works under your bottom lashes too to keep mascara from getting where it shouldn&#8217;t. 5. Setting spray.</p>
<p><strong><em>&#8220;boringporno.com&#8221;</em></strong></p>
<p>Sounds great. Good luck with that. Sorry I couldn&#8217;t help. Or, maybe I did. Since there aren&#8217;t any people f&#8217;ing on this site, this would make some pretty boring porno. So, I&#8217;m sorry. Or, you&#8217;re welcome.</p>
