										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I&#8217;m always on the lookout for new projects to start and abandon. I can&#8217;t help it, I&#8217;m just really passionate about half knitted scarves! Unfinished crafts are my life&#8217;s work.</p>
<p>Every once in a while, I screw up, and one gets done. Like these DIY watercolor mugs I found from <a href="http://www.poppytalk.com/2014/07/diy-watercolor-mug.html">Poppytalk</a>.</p>
<p><img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class=" aligncenter" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-EYB0c4IUXB4/U9XppeMC00I/AAAAAAABN_U/HE-jW40bx7Y/s1600/Final2.jpg" alt="" width="700" height="464" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>photo via Poppytalk</em></p>
<p>Gorgeous, right? I had the idea to put that lovely splash of color on a white ceramic pot as a birthday gift for a green thumbed friend! In my mind, she opens the box, pulls out the pot, and gets a tear in her eye from my beautiful, and very expensive looking, gift that was made all the more special by the fact that I did it with my own little hands. It was a very, very good plan.</p>
<p>Would the owner of this one of a kind piece of functional artwork please raise her hand?</p>
<p>&#8230;</p>
<p>&#8230;</p>
<p>Ok. I never sent it.</p>
<p>I have a good reason though! It came out, umm, not so good. She would have cried a little tear, but not from being overwhelmed by beauty and friendship.</p>
<p>Sorry, Missy.</p>
<p>Happy birthday?</p>
<p>This was extremely perplexing because my trial run came out pretty nice!</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1119" src="/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/watercolor-mug.jpg" alt="watercolor mug" width="640" height="640" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/watercolor-mug.jpg 640w, /wp-content/uploads/2015/01/watercolor-mug-150x150.jpg 150w, /wp-content/uploads/2015/01/watercolor-mug-300x300.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></p>
<p>Before I did the pot, I tried the process on a mug. It&#8217;s cool! I would have been happy if the pot had come out like this! I&#8217;m really sad it didn&#8217;t. I kind of feel like I know what I did wrong though, and I want to try it again. I&#8217;ve got nail polish <a title="Pretty Ladies All In a Row" href="/pretty-ladies-row/">out the yang</a>, and a lot of free time. Missy&#8217;s birthday might not be licked yet!</p>
<p>I bet you&#8217;re waiting to see the fucked up pot. Well, too bad. It&#8217;s too crusty looking, and it would bring great shame to our household. I&#8217;ll show it off when I get it right! Fingers crossed!</p>

<p>Thankfully, the diligent swatchers over at one of my favorite Instagram accounts, DUPE THAT, are all over the buying lots of makeup/still having money dichotomy. They&#8217;re in there every day, showing us how often we&#8217;re paying extra for luxury brand names. When you collect lipsticks like I do, this is some valuable information.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.dupethat.com/">DUPE THAT recently launched a full site.</a> The site is searchable for brands and color names, thereby fixing the one issue I had with their IG only operation. It&#8217;s very exciting!!</p>
<p>Are you off today? Maybe spend some time browsing their site and making lists. Are you working today? My suggestion still stands. Your boss says it&#8217;s cool!</p>

<p>Jane is rad. I love her whole everything! Her beauty videos at The Hairpin are especially great. Seriously, you&#8217;ll fall in love with her! Her videos are what made her part of my imaginary friend crew. I watch them, and then, it&#8217;s nothing but shopping montages and imaginary hip-hop slumber parties with Jane and Mindy Kaling in my mind&#8230;.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It&#8217;s a sad fact of the beauty industry that Women of Color are largely underrepresented. Products like BB creams often come in only one or two, light, colors, foundation shades rarely adequately consider darker skin tones. And &#8220;nude&#8221; colors? Don&#8217;t even get me started. The mainstream beauty industry&#8217;s limited offerings are the reason why, for as long as I can remember, I&#8217;ve watched my beautiful Latina mama struggle to find cosmetics that suit her complexion. She is a master of return policies, because everything from skin care products to eyeshadows have been troublesome. It makes me feel terrible for her! She has fantastic taste and she deserves to have a wide range of product choices!</p>
<p><a href="http://www.doobop.com/">Enter DOOBOP!!</a></p>
<blockquote><p>We are the premier beauty e-tailer dedicated to multiethnic women.<br />
Disrupting the beauty industry one day at a time.</p></blockquote>
<p>HELL YEAH!! That&#8217;s a revolution, baby! It gives me goosebumps. They have a wide range of  carefully curated hair, skin and beauty products for women of varying hair types and skin tones. It&#8217;s a really fabulous site! Since I first found out about it, I&#8217;ve been suggesting it all around. I want <a href="http://www.doobop.com/">DOOBOP</a> to stick around, I want <a href="http://www.doobop.com/">DOOBOP</a> to have competition, I want there to be a flood of products catering to WoC. Support and exposure are important for this mission, so I want to get the word out! I told my mom, I told friends, I&#8217;m telling everyone! You should too! Help your fellow sisters in beauty out. Be cool!</p>

<p>And for funsies, here&#8217;s a picture of us back when we were very young:</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Muse over at <a href="http://www.musingsofamuse.com/">Musings of a Muse</a> has all the info on the upcoming sale!</p>
<p><a href="http://www.musingsofamuse.com/2013/10/sephora-friends-family-sale-2013-november-7th-11th.html">&#8220;Every VIB and Rouge members get 20% Off their purchase in store or online at Sephora.com. Cards are in the mail and should arrive by November 4th or some folks don’t get a card via mail but one via e-mail instead so keep checking your inboxes and regular mail boxes this week and next week for your code. They’ll be a code for yourself as well as one you can share with a friend but you must be with your friend for them to redeem it in store along with your VIB membership card. You’ll also be able to get your hands on the traditional Sephora tote bag that is free with your purchase while supplies last. The promo code is VIBTOPIA.&#8221;</a></p>
<p>Unfortunately, it doesn&#8217;t look like regular Beauty Insider cardholders are going to get the 20% off coupon. That really eats balls, because I&#8217;m only $50 away from VIB status. This one is on me for not buying enough makeup, I guess. But, shit, man! My kid needs shoes! She has four feet, after all! I don&#8217;t know if you know this, but that&#8217;s double the amount of feet most kids have. Double! Double the school shoes, double the church shoes, double the summer sandals, double the sneakers!</p>
<p>It&#8217;s just a good thing she doesn&#8217;t eat that much.</p>
<p>Anyways! If you&#8217;re a VIB, congratulations! If you&#8217;re just a BI, like me, then kick rocks, I guess.</p>
<p><strong>***YET ANOTHER UPDATE***</strong></p>
<p>Sephora tweeted they&#8217;re doing something special for regular BI cardholders soon! I&#8217;ll keep an eye out, and post the information as soon as I see it.</p>
