										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Today&#8217;s gift guide is for all the nail junkies. Addicts with shoe boxes and bathroom drawers full of polish bottles, who are all strung out on the smell of acetone. Poor souls who can&#8217;t walk past a colorful display without taking just a tiny hit; just a little dab, just to see what it looks like on the nail&#8230;.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Pro Nail Polish Wall Rack Display</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-839" alt="nail rack" src="/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/nail-rack.jpg" width="430" height="500" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/nail-rack.jpg 430w, /wp-content/uploads/2013/12/nail-rack-258x300.jpg 258w" sizes="(max-width: 430px) 100vw, 430px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em><a href="&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004VN31JO/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B004VN31JO&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=thlabu-20&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://ir-na.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?t=thlabu-20&amp;l=as2&amp;o=1&amp;a=B004VN31JO&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; style=&quot;border:none !important; margin:0px !important;&quot; /&gt;">Amazon, $28</a></em></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">I got one of these for myself this year, and I love it. It&#8217;s on the wall, behind my desk, and I look at it every day. I literally stare at it every day. Seeing all my polish organized like that is extremely satisfying. This would be an AWESOME gift for anyone who loves and collects nail polish. Could you imagine how well this rack would go over? If I hadn&#8217;t bought this for myself, and someone else bought it for me as a gift, I would have lost my fucking mind. I would have unwrapped it and gone totally bananas. It&#8217;s the rare gift that is both fun and functional. Usually, I despise getting logical or functional gifts, but this rack is such a polish altar, it hardly registers as actually functional. Even though it is. Also, it&#8217;s a gift that says, &#8220;Hey. I validate your life choices, and I understand your needs. Here&#8217;s a place to store all those life choices.&#8221; <span style="line-height: 1.5em;">More than a place to store your bottles, it&#8217;s almost art. All those colors and glitters up on the wall, man, it&#8217;s good. Just remember, if you give or get a rack like this, you probably shouldn&#8217;t hang it in the bathroom. The temperature fluctuations aren&#8217;t good for the polish. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Floss Gloss Full Set Deux</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-840" alt="Screen Shot 2013-12-12 at 10.25.31 AM" src="/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/Screen-Shot-2013-12-12-at-10.25.31-AM.png" width="388" height="426" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/Screen-Shot-2013-12-12-at-10.25.31-AM.png 388w, /wp-content/uploads/2013/12/Screen-Shot-2013-12-12-at-10.25.31-AM-273x300.png 273w" sizes="(max-width: 388px) 100vw, 388px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://flossgloss.com/collections/lacquers/products/full-set-deux-colors-only"><em>Floss Gloss, $96</em></a></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">It&#8217;s no secret that I&#8217;m a huge Floss Gloss fan. I think I&#8217;ve bought every new color they&#8217;ve introduced since I found them. I&#8217;ve also bought most of the collection that came along before I knew about them. Their formula is great, and their colors are TITS. I can not get enough. Every time I get a new delivery from them that has more than one color, I end up locked in indecision for days. How do you choose? I wish I had more hands!! I have toes, but they&#8217;re gross. I mean, I paint my toenails, but they don&#8217;t look as fly as my fingernails; they look like little colorful shrimps. Little, cold, ashy shrimps.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Anyways! This set is a great gift for the polish aficionado in your life. You don&#8217;t have to pick a color, they get a shitload of nail polish, it&#8217;s a win win for everyone! Plus, if they don&#8217;t already know about Floss Gloss, how cool does that make you look? Extra super cool. This ain&#8217;t OPI. This is that new new indie ish. Fabulous colors, cool packaging, and it&#8217;s thoughtful. It&#8217;s thoughtful because if you buy someone all this nail polish, that frees up their cash to buy more nail polish, probably.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">If you don&#8217;t want to spend $96, or if you think your nail nerd will want some of the other colors not offered in this set, Floss Gloss also has gift cards.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter  wp-image-841" alt="floss gloss card" src="/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/floss-gloss-card.jpg" width="491" height="311" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/floss-gloss-card.jpg 1024w, /wp-content/uploads/2013/12/floss-gloss-card-300x190.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 491px) 100vw, 491px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://flossgloss.com/collections/gift-cards/products/gift-card"><em>Floss Gloss, $10-$100</em></a></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">These gift cards are available in amounts from $10-$100. It comes with all the same perks as the full set, the recipient will love it, you look super cool, plus, it&#8217;s so much easier to wrap!</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>ncLA Nail Wraps</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-842" alt="Screen Shot 2013-12-12 at 11.14.48 AM" src="/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/Screen-Shot-2013-12-12-at-11.14.48-AM.png" width="446" height="547" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/Screen-Shot-2013-12-12-at-11.14.48-AM.png 446w, /wp-content/uploads/2013/12/Screen-Shot-2013-12-12-at-11.14.48-AM-244x300.png 244w" sizes="(max-width: 446px) 100vw, 446px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://www.shopncla.com/"><em>ncLA, $16-$18</em></a></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">I was way over nail wraps until ncLA came along. Then, I saw their Melody Ehsani series of wraps, and I was, like, super horny for them. Horny sounds like the wrong word, but it&#8217;s the right word. Trust. The same tingles happen when a nail junkie sees something they need.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">I bought a couple different wraps from that line, and they were DOPE. The printing on the wraps is crisp, their designs are crazy fashion forward and they last forever. This is what the Melody Ehsani &#8220;Umoja&#8221; wraps looked like on my fingers:</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="aligncenter  wp-image-843" alt="Umoja wrap" src="/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/Umoja-wrap-768x1024.jpg" width="438" height="585" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/Umoja-wrap-768x1024.jpg 768w, /wp-content/uploads/2013/12/Umoja-wrap-225x300.jpg 225w, /wp-content/uploads/2013/12/Umoja-wrap.jpg 960w" sizes="(max-width: 438px) 100vw, 438px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>ART.</em></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">UGH. SO FLY. Doesn&#8217;t it just make you want to slap my face?! They look so good, I want to slap my own face. Each set comes with enough wraps to do a couple manicures. And I think you could probably use the wraps that don&#8217;t fit as extra mani embellishment. I&#8217;ve been thinking of cutting down the pieces that are too big, and using them over polish to create different designs.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">They have tons of different prints. They just released some really amazing transparent wraps that look soooo freaking cool. The <a href="http://www.shopncla.com/products/jagged-edge-1">&#8220;Jagged Edge&#8221;</a> and <a href="http://www.shopncla.com/products/cut-up">&#8220;Cut Up&#8221;</a> designs, in particular, are calling to me.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="aligncenter  wp-image-844" alt="Screen Shot 2013-12-12 at 11.41.13 AM" src="/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/Screen-Shot-2013-12-12-at-11.41.13-AM.png" width="420" height="489" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/Screen-Shot-2013-12-12-at-11.41.13-AM.png 461w, /wp-content/uploads/2013/12/Screen-Shot-2013-12-12-at-11.41.13-AM-257x300.png 257w" sizes="(max-width: 420px) 100vw, 420px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://www.shopncla.com/products/jagged-edge-1"><em>Jagged Edge</em></a></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Several wrap styles are on sale, too. The <a href="http://www.shopncla.com/products/dracula-s-bride">blood spatter design, &#8220;Dracula&#8217;s Bride,&#8221;</a> is a Halloween wrap, but I would wear it year round. These wraps would make awesome stocking stuffers, and if you sign up for ncLA&#8217;s email list, you&#8217;ll get 15% off your purchase. So, that&#8217;s good! You know I love a discount!</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Grab some cool gifts for your polish lover. They&#8217;ll think you&#8217;re super intuitive and ultra rad. Maybe they&#8217;ll scratch your back! Maybe not though. I don&#8217;t know what your relationship boundaries are.</p>
