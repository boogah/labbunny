<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Nicole by OPI &#8220;Pick of the Glitter,&#8221; Target exclusive</em></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">I&#8217;ve been off glitter (NOT ANTI GLITTER, NEVER ANTI) for a long while now. Taking off my nail polish is the part of doing my nails that I hate the most, and you know glitter takes forever to remove. Even though the tinfoil trick works, it&#8217;s way more time spent with corrosiveÂ chemicals on my fingers than I would prefer. These new base coats formulated specifically to make glitter removal easier tickle my fancy, but I keep forgetting to buy some at the beauty supply. So, that one is on me.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Nothing had been able to weaken my self-imposed glitter ban until this bottle of polish hypnotized me at Target. Admittedly, It&#8217;s not super hard to do since I&#8217;m already half out of my present state of mind at Target, but this bottle came home and it still captivated me. The polish is a really unusual color blend of large glitters in turquoise, gold, and iridescent lavender mixed with tiny flecks of a rose gold/bronze color. It&#8217;s fucking beautiful. The purple and rose gold colors really, really set off the other colors. I think it&#8217;s a brilliant combo of colors. Just fabulous.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-1019" src="/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/pick-of-the-glitter-1.jpg" alt="pick of the glitter 1" width="534" height="712" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/pick-of-the-glitter-1.jpg 1224w, /wp-content/uploads/2014/06/pick-of-the-glitter-1-225x300.jpg 225w, /wp-content/uploads/2014/06/pick-of-the-glitter-1-768x1024.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 534px) 100vw, 534px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Betsey Johnson ring, my jewelry box</em></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">I think this is the one and only time I&#8217;ve ever worn this ring. I was hitting the Betsey Johnson outlets pretty hard there for a second, and there&#8217;s a lot of jewelry hanging around my house that has never seen the light of day. I can&#8217;t bring myself to get rid of any of it though. THEY&#8217;RE MINE. WHAT IF I WANT TO WEAR THEM SOMEDAY?</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-1020 size-large" src="/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/pick-of-the-glitter-2-1024x1024.jpg" alt="pick of the glitter 2" width="696" height="696" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/pick-of-the-glitter-2-1024x1024.jpg 1024w, /wp-content/uploads/2014/06/pick-of-the-glitter-2-150x150.jpg 150w, /wp-content/uploads/2014/06/pick-of-the-glitter-2-300x300.jpg 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2014/06/pick-of-the-glitter-2-1272x1272.jpg 1272w, /wp-content/uploads/2014/06/pick-of-the-glitter-2.jpg 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 696px) 100vw, 696px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">I thought this polish would look gorgeous over a neutral color, so <a title="Pretty Ladies All In a Row" href="/pretty-ladies-row/">I went to the vault</a> and pulled out &#8220;Don&#8217;t Pretzel My Buttons&#8221; (yeesh these names *Tina Fey eye roll GIF*) by OPI. It&#8217;s an opaque sort of pinky nude color, and I used two thin coats to cover my nails before I used two coats of glitter.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Dammit. I kind of want a big pretzel now. UGH!! OPI COLOR NAMING DEPARTMENT, WHY MUST YOU MAKE ME SO HUNGRY?! AND HORMONES, YOU HAVE SOME SPLAINING TO DO, TOO.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-1021 size-large" src="/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/pick-of-the-glitter-3-836x1024.jpg" alt="pick of the glitter 3" width="696" height="852" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/pick-of-the-glitter-3-836x1024.jpg 836w, /wp-content/uploads/2014/06/pick-of-the-glitter-3-245x300.jpg 245w, /wp-content/uploads/2014/06/pick-of-the-glitter-3.jpg 1046w" sizes="(max-width: 696px) 100vw, 696px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">I know the lighting on this photo is weird, but it is so damn hard to get a solid picture of glitter. The reflective pieces make my camera go all crasy! You can see all the colors in the glitter in this picture though. So, success? I guess. I just really wanted you guys to be able to see everything. It&#8217;s so pretty!</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Like I said up top, this color is an elusive Target exclusive. I did not know that when I bought it, I was just having a lucky day. If I had known it was hard to find, I never would have randomly run across it. Trust. I couldn&#8217;t find it on Target.com, so, if you want it, you&#8217;ll have to actually go to Target to get it. Super sad, I know. It&#8217;s ok, don&#8217;t worry, while you&#8217;re at Target, you can get yourself a new scarf to dry your little tears!</p>
