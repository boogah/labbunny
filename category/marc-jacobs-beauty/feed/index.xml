										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Everyone has their favorite facial feature, and mine are definitely my lips. I like to look at them, I like to call attention to them, I love to play them up. It&#8217;s no secret that I buy A LOT of lipstick. And I won&#8217;t stop, cuz I can&#8217;t stop. ::Puffy Dance::</p>
<p><img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-897" alt="chapelle dance" src="/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/chapelle-dance.gif" width="500" height="340" /></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Because I am obsessed with my own mouth, when I paint it, I paint it with love. I also paint it with focus because I am always teetering close to the edge of crazy mouth. I gots all my tricks down, and I want to share them with you today. First, let&#8217;s take a look at my bare mouth.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter  wp-image-898" alt="bare mouth" src="/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/bare-mouth.jpg" width="461" height="354" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/bare-mouth.jpg 960w, /wp-content/uploads/2014/01/bare-mouth-300x230.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 461px) 100vw, 461px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Not bad, not bad. A little chewed, but nothing gross. Hydrated, exfoliated, I tweezed my mustache and got my one old lady chin hair. So, this is pretty much best case scenario. What I want to do is bring up the perimeters of my lips, shade where I want depth, and highlight where I want light. Although these steps can be used with pretty much any color, I&#8217;m going to demonstrate with a nude lip. Nude lips usually need the extra dimension anyways, so it works out.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Here&#8217;s what I&#8217;m using:</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-899" alt="lip tools" src="/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/lip-tools.jpg" width="640" height="480" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/lip-tools.jpg 640w, /wp-content/uploads/2014/01/lip-tools-300x225.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>Chapstick Hydration Lock</strong> &#8211; Prime and lightly moisturize.<br />
<strong>MAC Prep + Prime Highlighter in Radiant Rose</strong> &#8211; Um. To highlight.<br />
<strong>Cover Girl Perfect Blend Pencil in Mink</strong> &#8211; Shading, lining and contouring.<br />
<strong>MAC Matte Lipstick in Honey Love</strong> &#8211; Very nude, cream matte lipstick. I used this color to do a 60s inspired look for my wedding.<br />
<strong>Marc Jacobs Lovemarc Lip Gel in Role Play</strong> &#8211; A creamy rosy nude with a glossy finish.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">OK. First, I lightly apply my Chapstick. I don&#8217;t want to use too much, because it can make everything tricky. So, I use just enough to make sure my lips are smooth. Then, I line around my lips with the brown liner.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="aligncenter  wp-image-900" alt="brown liner" src="/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/brown-liner.jpg" width="574" height="346" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/brown-liner.jpg 1182w, /wp-content/uploads/2014/01/brown-liner-300x180.jpg 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2014/01/brown-liner-1024x616.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 574px) 100vw, 574px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Do you see how things are already happening?! It&#8217;s so exciting! This liner is a pretty cool brown color, and it&#8217;s going to make the edges of my mouth recede, so my lips themselves really stand out in the center. Then, with the spongy thing on the other end of the pencil, I blend the line so it isn&#8217;t harsh and obvious.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Next, I use my Prep + Prime pen to highlight the area above my lip. You know, above your cupid&#8217;s bow, where that little divot is? There! Like, so:</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="aligncenter  wp-image-901" alt="lip highlight" src="/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/lip-highlight.jpg" width="576" height="479" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/lip-highlight.jpg 960w, /wp-content/uploads/2014/01/lip-highlight-300x249.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 576px) 100vw, 576px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">The highlighter above your lip like that will give your top lip that little bit of upwards flare that really gives you a good, pillowy mouth. Blend that highlight color, and, if you like, set it with a little translucent powder. This is also where I add a little color to that mole next to my lip and set that with powder too. When I remember.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">And now we&#8217;re ready for lipstick!!!! First, I&#8217;ll show you the glossier, Marc Jacobs color.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="aligncenter  wp-image-902" alt="lips role play" src="/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/lips-role-play.jpg" width="576" height="404" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/lips-role-play.jpg 960w, /wp-content/uploads/2014/01/lips-role-play-300x210.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 576px) 100vw, 576px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Pretty good, right?! The line around the corner edges of my bottom lip looks darker on me than it might on you because, as you can see in the very first picture, the edges of my lips are naturally darker. This color works great with this whole technique because the shine in the lipstick really makes lips pop. I love it. This lipstick has become one of my go-to colors.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Now, we&#8217;ll see how it looks with MAC&#8217;s matte Honey Love.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="aligncenter  wp-image-903" alt="lips honey love" src="/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/lips-honey-love.jpg" width="576" height="463" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/lips-honey-love.jpg 960w, /wp-content/uploads/2014/01/lips-honey-love-300x240.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 576px) 100vw, 576px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Faaaaaaaabulous!! I added a little bit of pink-gold gloss in the very center of my lips to add some more depth to the flat color. If you want a truly matte, 60s mouth, skip this part. Like I said, I like to play up my lips, so I usually add a little dab.  I used NARS lip gloss in Super Orgasm. I forgot to take a picture of it. My bad! It&#8217;s not super crucial for you to see it, so it&#8217;s cool.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">I think adding shading around the mouth isn&#8217;t something most people think to do, but it makes a difference. I didn&#8217;t think to do it for a long time! I mean, I didn&#8217;t invent any of these tricks, they&#8217;re just things I&#8217;ve picked up over the years, put all together, and turned into my system for lips. I hope this has been helpful to somebody! Air kisses!</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">I&#8217;m about to wax reeeeeal rhapsodic about some lipstick, y&#8217;all. So, get ready!</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">When the Marc Jacobs Beauty line was launched, it was dizzying. Everything was so beautiful, and it all looked so sumptuous&#8230;it was impossible to figure out where to start! So, I put it off forever. But, when the Sephora F&amp;F sale came around, it was time to make it happen.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">I chose Role Play because I hardly ever buy neutral or nude colors, and I wanted to see if this lipstick was really worth the hype. Like, if this lipstick was SO AMAZING I&#8217;d even love it in a &#8220;cubicle&#8221; color, it was really some lipstick.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">You guys. It is SO AMAZING.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">This is the most luxurious lipstick I have used in, like, I don&#8217;t know, ever. It glides on so beautifully, without any tugging or friction. It feels cushiony and buttery on my lips. It&#8217;s a pleasure to wear. That sounds so stupid, but it&#8217;s true. It wears for hours without any feathering, it applies opaque with one application, and it feels hydrating. The tube is heavy and weighted nicely, with a sleek magnetic cap. Everything about this lipstick is extremely satisfying; the way it feels in your hand, on your lips, the delicious click the cap makes when the magnets connect, the way it looks! It&#8217;s an A+ product, no doubt.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Role Play is a mid toned dusty rose. It&#8217;s a really gorgeous color that goes well with a lot of looks. I&#8217;ve worn it with a smoky colored eye and a sort of bronze colored eye with equally awesome results.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="aligncenter  wp-image-797" alt="marc jacobs role play1" src="/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/marc-jacobs-role-play1-768x1024.jpg" width="557" height="742" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/marc-jacobs-role-play1-768x1024.jpg 768w, /wp-content/uploads/2013/11/marc-jacobs-role-play1-225x300.jpg 225w, /wp-content/uploads/2013/11/marc-jacobs-role-play1.jpg 960w" sizes="(max-width: 557px) 100vw, 557px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="aligncenter  wp-image-798" alt="marc jacobs role play2" src="/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/marc-jacobs-role-play2-768x1024.jpg" width="557" height="742" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/marc-jacobs-role-play2-768x1024.jpg 768w, /wp-content/uploads/2013/11/marc-jacobs-role-play2-225x300.jpg 225w, /wp-content/uploads/2013/11/marc-jacobs-role-play2.jpg 960w" sizes="(max-width: 557px) 100vw, 557px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Hope you like seeing my face!! Cuz there it is!!</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Buy yourself one of these lipsticks. They&#8217;re completely fabulous, and totally beautiful. I&#8217;m fully endorsing a $30 lipstick. My lipsticks don&#8217;t usually cost that much, but I&#8217;ll be more than happy to buy another one of these. I&#8217;m gonna get something BRIGHT next time!</p>
