<p>Back in November, Melt Cosmetics released their newest shade, a juicy, plummy color named Dark Room. When the site went live with the product drop, it was a madhouse. Luckily, having survived the great Missoni for Target Frenzy of 2011, I was prepared. When the dust settled and the lipsticks were sold out, I had my tube, and all was right in my world. Kind of dumb to not buy two, but, I was really in the zone and I had my eyes on the prize.</p>
<p>If you missed the chance to jump on this color in November, it&#8217;s coming back in stock, and it&#8217;s going to be permanent.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-1123 size-large" src="/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Melt-Dark-Room-collage-1024x1024.jpg" alt="Melt Dark Room collage" width="696" height="696" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Melt-Dark-Room-collage-1024x1024.jpg 1024w, /wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Melt-Dark-Room-collage-150x150.jpg 150w, /wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Melt-Dark-Room-collage-300x300.jpg 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Melt-Dark-Room-collage-1272x1272.jpg 1272w, /wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Melt-Dark-Room-collage.jpg 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 696px) 100vw, 696px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Miss you, nails.</em></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Melt described this lipstick color as the inside of a beet, and that&#8217;s pretty accurate. It&#8217;s a really rich, sumptuous shade. I liked it best with multiple layers blotted down. It&#8217;s matte, and it wears really well. I did a friend&#8217;s makeup for her wedding, and we used it to give her a dramatic lip for the reception.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-1124 " src="/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Melt-Dark-Room-pics-1024x1024.jpg" alt="Melt Dark Room pics" width="647" height="647" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Melt-Dark-Room-pics-1024x1024.jpg 1024w, /wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Melt-Dark-Room-pics-150x150.jpg 150w, /wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Melt-Dark-Room-pics-300x300.jpg 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Melt-Dark-Room-pics-1272x1272.jpg 1272w, /wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Melt-Dark-Room-pics.jpg 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 647px) 100vw, 647px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>The babely bride and yours truly, wearing Dark Room. </em></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Dark Room will be back in stock on February 4th, so if you want it, get your credit card all cleaned, sharpened, and ready to go. From what I can tell, when Melt restocks, the supply doesn&#8217;t last long. Get out there and chase that lipstick! Have you ever experienced the rush of successfully snagging your coveted product during one of these madhouse cosmetics releases? It&#8217;s a very triumphant feeling. AND, 7-10 days later, there&#8217;s lipstick at your door! BONUS.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Dat liner doe.</em></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">I&#8217;m a sucker for a purple lip.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Purple eyeshadow, too. I&#8217;m a sucker for purple eyeshadow.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">PURPLE NAILS! Don&#8217;t even get me started!!</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Long story short; I guess purple is my favorite color.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Well&#8230;and black. Is leopard a color? No, that&#8217;s silly! Leopard is a neutral!</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">&#8220;Leopard is a neutral,&#8221; has been my life motto since I was 16. I figured it out, and never looked back.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">WE&#8217;RE NOT PREACHING THE JOYS OF LEOPARD, SARAH. REMEMBER YOUR FIVE Gs.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1082" src="/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/latrice-gif.gif" alt="latrice gif" width="500" height="280" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><span style="text-align: left;">GOOD GOD, GET A GRIP, GIRL. </span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">The look above mixes up a purple lip with a leopard top, so I was pretty into it.  The lip is MAC&#8217;s Heroine, a vibrant, red-based purple. This color was a cult hit that MAC brought back, and made a part of their permanent collection. That&#8217;s good news because I could really see myself finishing this tube of lipstick. I mean, as soon as it came home, I made it a part of MY permanent collection (the zipper pouch inside my purse).</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Heroine has a satin finish, and it wears down to a bright matte that has a lot of staying power. I really appreciate that in a lip color. I love to do my makeup, but, I really hate having to constantly reapply my lip. I&#8217;m a modern woman! I don&#8217;t have time for that kind of nonsense. I don&#8217;t have time, and, also, I forget. And, also, pizza.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Oh, man. Pizza sounds so good right now. What time is it? 9:15?!?! Pizza isn&#8217;t even open yet. That&#8217;s ok. Everyone knows the sweetest pizza is the one you have to wait for.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">This lip color goes with all my favorite faces; neutral eye/bold lip, bold eye/bold lip, glasses/bold lip.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="aligncenter  wp-image-1081" src="/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/MAC-Heroine-x-glasses.jpg" alt="MAC Heroine x glasses" width="516" height="516" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/MAC-Heroine-x-glasses.jpg 960w, /wp-content/uploads/2014/09/MAC-Heroine-x-glasses-150x150.jpg 150w, /wp-content/uploads/2014/09/MAC-Heroine-x-glasses-300x300.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 516px) 100vw, 516px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Glasses/bold lip goes ANYWHERE, with EVERYTHING. I love it! If you wear glasses, and you want some compliments, do it. People fucking love it. If you don&#8217;t have glasses, I feel bad for you, you&#8217;re obviously a dum-dum. Everyone knows glasses make you super smart. Glasses are also the best way to hide your true beauty. When you take them off, everyone is super impressed by how good looking and popular you are! WOWZA.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">This post, you guys, it&#8217;s not so good. I&#8217;m sorry. I accidentally took a summer vacation, now I&#8217;m super rusty!</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="aligncenter  wp-image-1083" src="/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/Rusty.png" alt="Rusty" width="471" height="312" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/Rusty.png 400w, /wp-content/uploads/2014/09/Rusty-300x198.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 471px) 100vw, 471px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>ACTUAL SUPER RUSTY</em></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">That Rusty might be my favorite. I love the Anthony Michael Hall Rusty, but, this Rusty is hysterical to me. Those Rustys are tied for first? Second place is Nick Papagiorgio Rusty. David from Roseanne Rusty is neither here nor there for me.</p>
