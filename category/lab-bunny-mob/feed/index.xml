<p style="text-align: center;"><em>I wish I was this coconut.</em></p>
<p><em><strong>&#8220;I have a question.  How would you use an oil in your hair without your hair looking oily.  I want to start using coconut oil in my hair but HOW?!?!&#8221; &#8211; Denys</strong></em></p>
<p>Good question, D! I don&#8217;t want you to end up with a greasy mop on top.</p>
<p>When you start using ANY type of oil on your hair, there are two big things to remember that will go a long way towards keeping you shiny pretty and not stringy ugly: First, start with a small amount of oil and work up to more. You can always add extra oil if you need it, but you won&#8217;t be able to take care of it easily if you overdo it. Second, you always want to work from the ends of your hair, up. Unless you&#8217;re doing a deep conditioning, your roots don&#8217;t need the extra oil, but your ends do.</p>
<p>For coconut oil, specifically, use an organic virgin or extra virgin oil. Since it&#8217;s solid, you&#8217;ll want to melt it, or warm it up in your hands before using it. You can use it in day to day applications by running a small amount through your hair, from the ends to about your ears. Since water repels oil, dry hair works best. The internet says you can use dry shampoo to take care of accidental coconut oil overload, so even if you mess it up by using too much or going to high, there&#8217;s still hope.</p>
<p>If you want to use it as a deep conditioner, you can go crazy with it! Glop a whole bunch of it into your hair, massage it into your scalp, really thoroughly coat everything from root to tip, and then wrap it up in a shower cap. If you don&#8217;t have a shower cap, you can use plastic wrap. Shower caps are just easier, I always bring them home from hotels. Let the oil sit on your hair for at least 30 minutes, then shampoo it out. When deep conditioning, you can leave your treatment on for as long as you want, really. You can sleep in it if you&#8217;re so inclined, although I think that&#8217;s dangerous business. I used to do that kind of thing when I was a kid, but that seems like so much trouble now. You can also warm your hair while it&#8217;s in the shower cap or plastic wrap with a blow dryer set to low to really help the oil penetrate. I do that when I&#8217;m feeling particularly ambitious with my deep conditioners, so, you know, not often. It works though!</p>
<p>With any new beauty treatment/skill, the key is always practice. You might really fuck it up the first time, but probably not the 5th or 6th time. Stick with it, and let me know how it goes!</p>
