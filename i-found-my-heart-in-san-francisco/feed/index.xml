					<description><![CDATA[So, I&#039;ve read your blog for a long time. I&#039;ve always laughed hysterically and felt a kinship to you due to our mutual love of all things beauty. But I could have written your last two blogs about depression word for word. The last 6 months have been my latest venture into the funk of depression and anxiety, and until you&#039;ve been there, it is SO hard to put into words. So thank you for making me feel not so alone in this long battle and also for reminding me that indulging in treats can be their very own form of therapy! A dinner of mac and cheese, bread, and an M&#038;M cookie combined with the latest episode of Pretty Little Liars was almost as effective as my Lexapro to this 28 year old&#039;s soul! Hugs to you.]]></description>

You got that right, sister! Hotel stays are relaxing to me because I don&#039;t have to feel bad about watching TV instead of doing laundry, or whatever. Those towels ain&#039;t mine to wash. Guilt free leisure time!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[So glad to hear about all the epic spoiling you&#039;ve done for yourself...you deserve it!  Bad movies and guilt-free junk food are two of my favorite pick-me-ups too, plus a hotel stay always just feels incredibly relaxing and refreshing.  Bonus points to you for the Romy &#038; Michelle reference!  And for learning the reaching out lesson.  Why have a blog if you can&#039;t solicit your loyal followers for help? ;)]]></description>
