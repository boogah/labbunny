It gets streaky and slides all around the place if you touch it.  So I wouldn&#039;t exactly say it dissolves...migrates is closer to the truth.  If you can dry it without touching it, you&#039;re okay.  I just drank my beer through a straw for the night once I fixed it, just to be safe.  I&#039;ve had other lipstick/stains that held up to water way better, but they also didn&#039;t last nearly as long as this one does if it stays dry.  Just be careful!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[That Stila lipstick is so amazing, I have it in Fiery!  It&#039;s pretty much the only lipstick I can handle because I know it&#039;s not flying all over my face throughout the day.  Word of warning though, stay the hell away from water when you&#039;ve got it on...I learned that one the hard way this summer.  I was a bridesmaid in my friend&#039;s wedding and had my lips perfect, until I got bored, started flipping my bouquet upside down, and then dripped water on my face.  I went from Bettie Page to Ronald McDonald immediately.  Good haul though!!]]></description>
