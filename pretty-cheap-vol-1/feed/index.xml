If you had paid for that blue mascara, Long&#039;s may have had just enough income to stay in business. So now you have THAT on your conscience.]]></description>

Thanks for sharing your experience with the mask! I mentioned something about it stinging and being careful if your skin is sensitive, but I&#039;m going to add an update that lets people know about the issues you&#039;ve had.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Ooh, butter lipstick. I&#039;m gonna get on that.

A note about Queen Helene&#039;s.. I have to say, I have sensitive skin, and it destroys me. When I was younger than 20, it was fine. Now that my skin is aging, it is asking for trouble. It dries me out way too much, it burns like hell, and leaves me with a thin, frail, red mess.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Up and Up (Target&#039;s brand) has a make-up remover wipe that I like.  I just bought a four pack (of 30 wipes/pack) for $9.99 ($2.50 a pack).  It sounds like they do the same things as the one you are recommending - take off face and eye make-up, but struggle with eye liner and mascara.  Anyway, just thought I&#039;d throw that out there for those who are extra, EXTRA cheap and sexy.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Dude. The only thing I have ever shoplifted was a tube of bright blue mascara from Long&#039;s.  I was 9 or 10. I still feel badly about it. Mostly because I risked my spotless criminal record for blue mascara (which I wasn&#039;t even allowed to wear!). This post speaks to my pre-adolescent heart. 

There&#039;s a statute of limitations on that kind of stuff, right?]]></description>
