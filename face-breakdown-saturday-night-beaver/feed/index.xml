					<description><![CDATA[http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/f/fc/Adam_and_the_Ants_1981.jpg

This is currently my favourite picture on the internet, feat. Adam and the Ants in full pirate glory. So liner galore, winged out shadow (Adam has pink on his right eye, but I prefer blue, and symmetry) and serious contouring in a strange colour ( http://www.toyah.net/fallingtoearth/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/herbschulz12b1.jpg ), the last of which I am not game to rock during daylight hours. Maybe for a fancy dress party :)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;/face-breakdown-saturday-night-beaver/#comment-911&quot;&gt;Madeleine&lt;/a&gt;.

&quot;Madeleine is an 80s new romantic pirate&quot; as a style direction sounds fucking great! I&#039;ve been kicking around a similar idea for a while, but I can&#039;t get past just wanting a thick, black stripe across my eyes like Adam Ant. You&#039;ve inspired me to play with it! What does that look mean for you when you do it? I&#039;m betting it&#039;s something better than one black stripe! 

My necklace is Betsey Johnson, but it&#039;s a few years old. There has to be another one kicking around on the internet somewhere!

Thanks for the compliments, and the comment! I hope you keep reading! XO]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Love this! Seriously fabulous lipstick/sparkle/are your lips magical??
UD Gonzo is one of my favourites for super fancy looks, I had a &#039;Madeleine is an 80s new romantic pirate&#039; kind of day a little while ago with lots of smoked-out gonzo and a splash of gold. 70s disco glam now on my to-do list, glitter and dancing included :)
Your blog is wonderful!

PS that necklace! Might I enquire as to where it came from?]]></description>
