					<description><![CDATA[Grossness of this aside, I literally just bought an acrylic nail polish rack last week.  I recently turned my guest bedroom closet into a kick-ass vanity area, and getting my polishes organized was at the top of my list of things to do.  I had zero luck looking for one locally, but this one on Amazon looked cheap and had great reviews.  A 96 bottle holder did not sound excessive for my collection...and I was right.  Super easy to get mounted on the wall (although the hubby did add some anchors not provided) and it looks awesome. If you haven&#039;t found one already, take a look at this. http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004VN31JO/ref=oh_details_o02_s00_i00?ie=UTF8&#038;psc=1]]></description>
