I used to wear stuff like that too! That&#039;s not bad, that&#039;s just being a teenager. When I was in my early 20s though, I dyed my hair this terrible brick red color, and then was penciling my eyebrows the same color. AWWWWFUL. That color made my skin look disgusting.]]></description>

Those cheap manicures are hard to pass up! I just tell myself that I&#039;ll probably get a staph infection and keep walking.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hmmm I think my jr high- junior years of school I dressed really weird. I don&#039;t think my makeup was ever too bad, but I wore my docs with anything, and sometimes mixed their colors, a red on one foot, green on the other. when i got my 20 eyes and grip fasts, my skirts and dresses just got shorter, and more into the black side.
 I once or twice wore checkered tights with a checkered skirt, or a floppy hat that just looked like grass took a shit on my head. Omg! I wore a tiara, and sometimes cat ears. Shoot I can&#039;t believe I went in to study fashion design. I still think I may have some crazy mental fashion quirks but no way like I used to.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Getting &quot;cheap&quot; manicures at random storefronts that only last about 5 minutes, and being too lazy to fix them myself.

Way-too-dark foundation was a big one for me, especially since I&#039;m like one stage lighter than Ivory. I thought I could just match my cheek color and call it a day.]]></description>
